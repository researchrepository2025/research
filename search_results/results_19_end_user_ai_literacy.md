# Research Results: Enterprise End-User AI Literacy

## Executive Summary

This research examines what "easy" and effective AI literacy would look like for enterprise business users (non-technical), grounded in evidence from 2025 sources. The findings reveal a significant gap between the ideal state of universal AI competency and current reality: while [88% of organizations use AI in at least one function](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/quantumblack/our-insights/the-state-of-ai) (McKinsey, 2025), only 28% of organizations have positioned employees to achieve transformative business impact from AI, and [74% of companies struggle to achieve and scale AI value](https://www.bcg.com/publications/2025/are-you-generating-value-from-ai-the-widening-gap) (BCG, 2025).

Key findings include:
- **Skills Gap is the Primary Barrier**: [63% of employers cite skills gaps as their main barrier to AI transformation](https://www.weforum.org/publications/the-future-of-jobs-report-2025/) (WEF, January 2025)
- **Training Investment is Insufficient**: [Only 45% of UK enterprises offer company-wide or role-specific AI training](https://newsroom.ibm.com/2025-10-28-IBM-Report-Two-Thirds-of-UK-Firms-Gain-from-AI-Reskilling-Key-to-Unlocking-Greater-Productivity) (IBM, October 2025)
- **Trust Calibration Remains Unsolved**: [Legal AI tools still hallucinate 17-34% of the time](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jels.12413) on benchmark queries (Stanford/Journal of Empirical Legal Studies, 2025)
- **Change Management is Critical**: Organizations following [BCG's 10/20/70 rule](https://www.bcg.com/publications/2025/are-you-generating-value-from-ai-the-widening-gap) (10% algorithms, 20% tech/data, 70% people/processes) achieve significantly higher value (BCG, 2025)
- **Microlearning Shows Promise**: [80% completion rates for microlearning vs. 20% for traditional courses](https://elearningindustry.com/microlearning-statistics-facts-and-trends) (eLearning Industry, 2025)

## SECTION 1: What Would Easy, Universal End-User AI Literacy Look Like?

### 1.1 Vision: Every Business User Confidently and Effectively Uses AI

**THE IDEAL:**
In the ideal state, every enterprise business user would:
- Possess foundational AI literacy enabling confident interaction with AI tools without fear or hesitation
- Understand AI capabilities and limitations sufficiently to make appropriate use decisions
- Achieve measurable productivity gains (up to 40% according to [EY 2025 Work Reimagined Survey](https://www.ey.com/en_gl/newsroom/2025/11/ey-survey-reveals-companies-are-missing-out-on-up-to-40-percent-of-ai-productivity-gains-due-to-gaps-in-talent-strategy)) through routine AI use
- Require minimal ongoing support, with AI tools being as intuitive as other standard business software
- Self-regulate usage patterns with appropriate trust calibration (neither over-reliance nor under-utilization)
- Adapt to new AI tools within days rather than weeks or months

**CLOSEST ACHIEVED:**
- **Microsoft (Internal Deployment)**: Deployed Copilot across the enterprise, with [70% of Fortune 500 companies now using Copilot](https://www.microsoft.com/insidetrack/blog/driving-copilot-for-microsoft-365-adoption-with-our-copilot-champs-community/). Built a champion community model where Copilot champions provide peer support and training. Research shows scheduling [training within 48 hours of receiving Copilot access results in higher feature adoption](https://www.microsoft.com/insidetrack/blog/staying-ahead-of-the-ai-curve-with-microsoft-365-copilot-how-a-champion-does-it/).

- Effortless and embedded in daily workflows (just-in-time learning)
- Personalized to role, function, and individual learning pace
- Achievable with completion rates exceeding 80% (vs. typical corporate training completion of 20-50%)
- Time-efficient: proficiency achieved in hours/days, not weeks/months
- Continuously adaptive as AI tools evolve
- Delivered through intuitive interfaces requiring minimal technical background

**CLOSEST ACHIEVED:**

### 1.3 Vision: Optimal Trust Calibration and Critical Evaluation

**THE IDEAL:**
In the ideal state, users would:
- Accurately calibrate trust to AI system capabilities and limitations
- Appropriately verify high-stakes outputs without creating workflow bottlenecks
- Identify hallucinations and errors before they cause business harm
- Maintain critical thinking skills while leveraging AI efficiency
- Neither over-rely (automation complacency) nor under-utilize (AI avoidance)
- Understand when to trust vs. verify based on context and risk level

## Gaps and Limitations of This Research

### Data Limitations
1. **Self-Reported Metrics**: Many statistics rely on survey data subject to response bias
2. **Vendor Bias**: Significant portion of training effectiveness data comes from platform vendors
3. **Regional Variation**: Most data US/Western-centric; global applicability uncertain
4. **Sample Size Gaps**: Some statistics lack disclosed sample sizes or methodologies

### Evidence Gaps Identified
1. **No documented evidence** of standardized AI champion certification programs with validated outcomes
2. **Limited research** on long-term knowledge retention for AI skills specifically
3. **No gold standard** AI literacy measurement tool validated across populations (as of systematic reviews)
4. **Insufficient data** on role-specific training curriculum effectiveness with control groups
5. **Limited case studies** of AI literacy program failures with detailed post-mortems

### Methodological Concerns
1. BCG/McKinsey statistics based on proprietary surveys with potential selection bias
2. Training completion rates measured differently across platforms (not comparable)
3. "AI adoption" defined inconsistently across surveys (basic use vs. transformative use)
4. Causality difficult to establish (correlation between AI training and business outcomes)

### Areas Requiring Further Research
1. Validated AI literacy assessments for enterprise business users (not students)
2. Longitudinal studies on AI skill retention and decay
3. Cross-cultural validation of AI literacy frameworks
4. Controlled studies on training modality effectiveness for AI skills
5. ROI measurement frameworks specific to AI literacy investment
