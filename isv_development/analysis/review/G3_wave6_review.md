# G3: Wave 6 Cross-Cutting Analysis — Quality Review

**Reviewer:** G3 Quality Reviewer
**Date:** 2026-02-19
**Files Reviewed:** CC1 through CC5
**Ratings Source:** `analysis/three_phase_on_prem_ratings.md`
**Scope:** Citation integrity, scope discipline, analysis quality, content depth, cross-file consistency, and spot-check verification

---

## CC1: CC1_math_audit.md

- **Score:** PASS
- **Citation integrity:** Strong. All calculations trace directly to `three_phase_on_prem_ratings.md` with section-level references. Cross-references to prior reviews (RP3c, RP3d) are correctly attributed. No external citations required by scope. The source list at the end enumerates all referenced files with paths.
- **Scope discipline:** Excellent. CC1 strictly limits itself to arithmetic verification and does not assess whether any rating is substantively correct. Section 1 explicitly declares this boundary: "Arithmetic correctness only — no assessment of whether ratings are substantively accurate." The audit never crosses into qualitative judgment about rating values.
- **Analysis quality:** Rigorous. All 47 discrete arithmetic checks are shown with complete working: individual subsegment values are listed, sums computed, averages calculated, and compared to stated values. The Discrepancy Register (Section 10) correctly classifies errors by type (rounding convention vs. rounding error vs. material arithmetic error) with precise magnitudes. The Phase 1 and Phase 2 effort estimate validation (Sections 6-7) shows midpoint approximations with explicit parallel-execution assumptions.
- **Content depth:** Complete. All required sub-topics are addressed: plane-level averages (12 checks across 4 planes x 3 phases), Grand Summary matrix consistency (24 cells verified), All-Phase Avg columns (8 values verified), cross-phase Total rows (6 values checked, 2 errors found), Phase 1 effort estimates (4 planes), Phase 2 effort estimates (4 planes plus the P1=~60% claim), and Phase 3 FTE totals (4 planes plus corrected grand total). The P3 FTE understatement finding (D-7) is confirmed from RP3d with independent arithmetic.
- **Spot-check result:** Verified P1 Phase 1 RD average. Ratings file lists CP-01 through CP-10 RD values as 5, 5, 4, 5, 4, 4, 5, 4, 4, 4. Sum = 44. 44/10 = 4.4. CC1 states 4.4. Additionally verified the P3 Phase 3 FTE aggregate: summing DS1-DS10 low bounds (1.50+0.60+0.40+0.25+0.40+1.50+0.70+1.25+2.00+3.25) = 11.85. The ratings file states "~10-18 FTE." CC1 correctly identifies this as a material understatement of 1.85 FTE at the low end.
- **Issues found:** None material. The analysis is thorough and accurate. One minor note: the Phase 1 Total RD discrepancy (D-2) reports 101/34 = 2.971 which "rounds to 3.0," but the ratings file states 2.9. The analysis in the executive summary calls this a "minor rounding error," which is the correct characterization — though one could argue it is a deliberate presentation choice to round down rather than up when the value sits at 2.971. This is a judgment call, not an error in CC1.

## CC2: CC2_divergence_rederivation.md

- **Score:** PASS
- **Citation integrity:** Strong. Every gap calculation cites the specific section of `three_phase_on_prem_ratings.md` from which ratings were extracted. Cross-references to `RP2c_P2_divergence_investigation.md` and `RP3b_P3_streaming_ai_data.md` are correctly attributed with section-level specificity. The DS10 Phase 3 misapplication finding is correctly traced to its original identification in RP3b.
- **Scope discipline:** Excellent. CC2 rigorously confines itself to divergence flag analysis. The review independently calculates all RD-TE gaps and audits flag placement against the stated threshold. It never questions whether the underlying RD or TE ratings are correct — it treats them as given and only evaluates the gap calculation and flag placement. The near-miss inventory (Section 9) is a valid extension that stays within scope by documenting cells that approach but do not reach the threshold.
- **Analysis quality:** Rigorous and thorough. The complete 102-active-cell audit is presented with full tables showing every subsegment's gap, whether a flag exists, whether a flag is required, and the verdict. The executive summary correctly reports the count (note: CC2 initially says "114 cells" in the title, then clarifies to 102 active cells in Section 1 — the 114 figure counts customer-scope blanks, and this is addressed). The identification of three misapplied [D] flags (AL10 Phase 1 at gap +1, AL10 Phase 3 at gap +1, DS10 Phase 3 at gap +1) and one correctly placed flag (AL02 Phase 3 at gap +3) is independently verified against the ratings file. The AL05 Phase 3 ambiguity (where [D] appears in the Notes column rather than as a standalone flag) is handled with appropriate nuance.
- **Content depth:** Comprehensive. All four planes across all three phases are audited. The P2 "+0.9 systematic divergence" validation (Section 7) goes beyond simple arithmetic to test whether removing the AL02 outlier destroys the systematic pattern (it does not — residual average of +0.67). Section 8 critically evaluates Section 7 of the ratings file, identifying that the divergence narrative table is a curated selection rather than an exhaustive inventory and catching a minor rounding issue in the "Phase 2, All planes" gap figure.
- **Spot-check result:** Verified AL10 Phase 1 [D] flag. Ratings file line 93: AL10 RD=3, TE=4. Gap = TE - RD = 4 - 3 = +1. The [D] threshold is 2+ points. CC2 correctly identifies this as misapplied. Also verified AL02 Phase 3: ratings file line 241 shows RD=1, TE=4, gap = +3. CC2 correctly identifies this as the only correctly placed [D] flag. Also verified AL05 Phase 3: ratings file line 244 shows `**[D]**` in the Notes column for AL05 (RD=2, TE=3, gap=+1). CC2's characterization of this as an ambiguous but technically misapplied flag is accurate.
- **Issues found:**
  1. *Minor methodological inconsistency in Section 8, finding 3:* CC2 states the "Phase 2, All planes" gap is "+0.075" based on averaging per-plane average gaps (unweighted). However, the ratings file computes this as a subsegment-weighted aggregate: total Phase 2 RD sum = 61, total Phase 2 TE sum = 61 (from CC1 Section 3.5), giving 61/34 - 61/34 = 0.000. The ratings file's 0.0 figure is arithmetically correct under weighted averaging. CC2's 0.075 figure uses unweighted plane-average averaging ((-0.1+0.1-0.2+0.5)/4), which is a different (and arguably less appropriate) methodology for an "all planes" aggregate. CC2 does characterize this as "a minor rounding artifact," which is generous — it is more precisely a methodological difference. This does not affect any downstream finding.
- **Fix recommendations:** Consider adding a footnote to Section 8 finding 3 clarifying that the 0.0 figure in the ratings file is correct under subsegment-weighted averaging, while the 0.075 figure reflects unweighted plane-average averaging.

## CC3: CC3_cross_phase_consistency.md

- **Score:** PASS
- **Citation integrity:** Strong. All trajectory data points cite the specific sections of `three_phase_on_prem_ratings.md` with SOURCE-1 identifier. Direct quotations from the ratings file's notes are marked as [FACT from source] with section-level attribution. Cross-references to GT5, G1, and S1 are appropriately attributed as SOURCE-2 through SOURCE-4. The source table at the end provides absolute file paths.
- **Scope discipline:** Excellent. CC3 limits itself to trajectory analysis (whether ratings tell a logically consistent story across phases) and explicitly does not re-derive individual ratings. The five "inconsistencies" identified are framed as trajectory questions, not rating corrections. The analysis correctly distinguishes between logical inconsistencies (Phase 3 RD exceeding Phase 1 RD) and presentational issues (numeric TE equality across phases with different absolute scales).
- **Analysis quality:** Thoughtful and structured. The complete trajectory table (Section 1) is a valuable reference artifact that did not exist in prior reviews. The five flagged inconsistencies are well-analyzed: AL09 (Phase 3 RD > Phase 1 RD) is correctly identified as the most structurally unusual trajectory; AL02 (TE jump from 1 to 4) is correctly diagnosed as a scale-difference presentation issue rather than a logical error; CP-02, S1/S6, and CP-08 are correctly identified as lower-severity numeric coincidences explained by phase-specific absolute scales. The Section 4 aggregate trajectory assessment provides useful structural validation that the overall Phase 1 > Phase 2 < Phase 3 pattern holds.
- **Content depth:** Thorough. All 34 active subsegments (plus 4 customer-scope exclusions noted) have complete trajectory tables across all three phases. The flag catalog (Section 2) defines five flag types with clear operational definitions. Section 5 confirms the absence of Phase 3 < Phase 2 TE violations, which is a fundamental consistency check. The severity matrix (Section 6) provides actionable resolution paths for each inconsistency.
- **Spot-check result:** Verified AL09 trajectory values. From the ratings file: Phase 1 AL09 (line 92): RD=2, TE=3. Phase 2 AL09 (line 170): RD=1, TE=2. Phase 3 AL09 (line 248): RD=3, TE=4. CC3 correctly reports these values and correctly identifies AL09 as the only subsegment where Phase 3 RD strictly exceeds Phase 1 RD.
- **Issues found:**
  1. *DS2 flagging error:* In the P3 trajectory table (Section 1), DS2 is flagged "P3-TE<P2-TE (TE drops)" with values P2 TE=1, P3 TE=2. But P3 TE (2) is greater than P2 TE (1), not less. Section 5 then catches and corrects this as a "drafting artifact," but the flag remains in the trajectory table itself and is not removed. This is self-contradictory within the document.
  2. *DS7 flag error in trajectory table:* DS7 is flagged "P3-TE>P1-TE" in the trajectory table, but DS7 has Phase 1 TE=3 and Phase 3 TE=3 — these are equal. Section 2.2 then lists DS7 with "Delta 0" and calls it "Not a flag." Again, the flag remains in the table but is retracted in the analysis. Both errors are self-corrected within the document but create internal inconsistency.
- **Fix recommendations:** Remove the "P3-TE<P2-TE (TE drops)" flag from DS2 in the Section 1 trajectory table. Remove the "P3-TE>P1-TE" flag from DS7 in the Section 1 trajectory table. Both are identified as drafting artifacts in the analysis text, but the trajectory tables themselves should be corrected for consistency.

## CC4: CC4_scope_consistency.md

- **Score:** PASS
- **Citation integrity:** Strong. Every scope claim is traced to a specific section and row of `three_phase_on_prem_ratings.md` with [FACT] markers and section citations. Cross-references to source files (`P1_control_plane.md`, `P2_application_logic.md`, `P3_data_plane.md`, `G1_n_services_multiplier.md`) and prior reviews (`RP4b_P4_scope_exclusion.md`) are correctly attributed with section-level specificity. The source table at the end provides complete paths.
- **Scope discipline:** Excellent. CC4 limits itself to scope boundary consistency — whether the customer-owns-hardware / ISV-owns-software split is consistently applied. It does not re-derive ratings or question whether ratings are appropriate for the scope assignment. The analysis systematically checks every plane, every phase, and every potentially ambiguous vocabulary choice against the §1 scope definition.
- **Analysis quality:** Rigorous and methodical. The 16-check summary table (Section 9) provides a complete audit trail. The DS9 finding (Section 5) is the strongest analytical contribution: CC4 identifies that the ratings file correctly reduced DS9 difficulty from 5/5 to 3/3 but failed to reduce the FTE figure (2.0-3.25), which was derived under ISV-manages-GPU assumptions. This is a genuine and material scope inconsistency. The Phase 2 heading vocabulary issue ("Per-Customer Hardware Customization") is appropriately flagged as a minor heading-level imprecision rather than a substantive scope error.
- **Content depth:** Comprehensive. All four planes across all three phases are checked. P4 S2-S5 customer scope consistency is verified in all three phases (Section 2). Hardware-adjacent language in P1 is checked in all three phases (Section 3). P3 data plane hardware language is checked in all three phases (Section 4). The DS9 source file discrepancy (Section 5) is the most substantive finding and includes clear recommended actions. The RP4b residual obligations (Section 10, Ambiguity 4) correctly cross-reference unrated ISV obligations identified in prior review work.
- **Spot-check result:** Verified DS9 Phase 1 scope language. Ratings file line 108 reads: "Customer provides GPU; ISV deploys embedding model serving on customer's GPU allocation. Pipeline logic (chunking, batch processing, vector store integration) is application-level. Reduced from original 5/5 because GPU hardware is customer scope." RD=3, TE=3. CC4 accurately identifies this text, the difficulty reduction from 5 to 3, and the FTE carry-over issue.
- **Issues found:**
  1. *Minor reference error in Section 7:* CC4 references "`two_phase_on_prem_ratings.md`" when citing the AL10 Phase 3 notes, but the actual file is `three_phase_on_prem_ratings.md`. This is a typographical error in the file name reference.
- **Fix recommendations:** Correct the file name reference in Section 7 from `two_phase_on_prem_ratings.md` to `three_phase_on_prem_ratings.md`.

## CC5: CC5_missing_risks.md

- **Score:** PASS
- **Citation integrity:** Strong for internal citations. All references to `three_phase_on_prem_ratings.md` are specific (section, row, and quoted text). Cross-references to prior reviews (RP4c, RP2e, RP1a) are correctly attributed. External citations are extensive (16 external URLs listed), with clear source attribution including publication name, date, and URL. One external citation quality issue is noted below.
- **Scope discipline:** Good. CC5 limits itself to gap identification and explicitly states "No existing ratings are re-derived or modified in this document." The six identified gaps are correctly framed as categories absent from or underweighted in the existing framework, not as corrections to existing ratings. One borderline scope issue: Section 3.2 argues that AL05 Phase 1 (RD 3 / TE 3) "may underweight" the Step Functions to Temporal migration — this edges toward re-derivation of an existing rating rather than pure gap identification. However, the framing is that the underlying vendor lock-in phenomenon is underweighted as a category, not that AL05's specific numbers should change, which keeps it within scope.
- **Analysis quality:** Strong. The six gap categories (organizational change management, customer communication overhead, vendor lock-in reversal, supply chain security, talent acquisition, regulatory variance) are well-chosen and genuinely represent categories absent from the 38-subsegment framework. Each gap section follows a consistent structure: what the framework currently captures (with citations), what it does not capture (with external evidence), and a gap classification. The most analytically sophisticated section is Section 4 (supply chain security), which decomposes the gap into three distinct dimensions (SBOM generation, CVE velocity across N environments, and artifact mirror security for air-gapped environments). The Section 1.3 honesty marker — "[UNVERIFIED: No published ISV case study with quantified organizational change management cost...]" — demonstrates intellectual rigor.
- **Content depth:** Comprehensive for a gap analysis. All six gaps include both internal and external evidence. The regulatory variance section (Section 6) includes three concrete scenarios (FedRAMP vs. GDPR, CMMC vs. HIPAA, state-level AI regulations) that illustrate the gap concretely. The talent acquisition section (Section 5) includes quantitative data (40% lack K8s skills/headcount, 5.4 month average hiring cycle, $140K-$200K salary range). The deployment failure mode evidence (Section 7) adds the CrowdStrike Falcon incident as a concrete illustration of blast radius risk.
- **Spot-check result:** Verified Spectro Cloud and Linux Foundation external citations. The Spectro Cloud URL (https://www.spectrocloud.com/state-of-kubernetes-2025) resolves to the correct report landing page for the "State of Production Kubernetes 2025" report based on 455 respondents. However, the specific statistics CC5 cites ("40% say they lack the skills and headcount to manage Kubernetes") are not visible on the landing page; they may be in the downloadable PDF report. This makes the citation plausible but not directly verifiable from the URL alone. The Linux Foundation URL (https://www.linuxfoundation.org/blog/the-2024-state-of-tech-talent-report) was verified: the page confirms the "5.4 months on average for recruitment" and "64% taking over four months to fill open positions" statistics as cited by CC5. The domain-specific talent shortage percentages (68% AI/ML, 65% cybersecurity, etc.) are not visible on the blog post and may be in the full downloadable report.
- **Issues found:**
  1. *Partial verifiability of Spectro Cloud statistics:* The specific claim "40% say they lack the skills and headcount to manage Kubernetes" is attributed to Spectro Cloud's 2025 State of Production Kubernetes report, but this statistic is not visible on the report landing page. It may exist in the downloadable PDF. The citation should note that the statistic is from the full report rather than the landing page.
  2. *Linux Foundation domain-specific percentages not on cited page:* The claim "The talent shortage is especially acute in strategic domains: AI and ML engineering (68%), cybersecurity and compliance (65%)..." is attributed to the Linux Foundation 2024 State of Tech Talent Report blog post, but these specific percentages are not visible on the cited blog page. They may be in the full downloadable report. The citation should distinguish between the blog summary and the full report.
  3. *Minor scope boundary crossing in Section 3.2:* The argument that AL05 Phase 1 RD 3 / TE 3 "may underweight" the Step Functions to Temporal migration brushes against re-derivation of existing ratings. This is borderline but acceptable given the framing as a systemic underweighting of vendor lock-in reversal cost rather than a specific rating correction.
- **Fix recommendations:** For findings 1 and 2, add parenthetical notation to the relevant citations distinguishing between the report landing page/blog summary and the full downloadable report (e.g., "Spectro Cloud, 2025 State of Production Kubernetes (full report, accessible from landing page)").

## Summary

- **Files passing:** 5 of 5
- **Files with minor issues:** 3 (CC2, CC3, CC4)
  - CC2: Methodological inconsistency in Section 8 on Phase 2 aggregate gap calculation (unweighted vs. weighted averaging)
  - CC3: Two drafting artifact flags (DS2, DS7) remain in the trajectory table despite being corrected in the analysis text
  - CC4: Typographical error referencing `two_phase_on_prem_ratings.md` instead of `three_phase_on_prem_ratings.md`
- **Files needing rework:** 0
- **Cross-file consistency notes:**
  1. **No contradictions found between the five CC files.** Each operates within its designated scope boundary and the findings are complementary rather than conflicting.
  2. **CC1 and CC2 findings are mutually consistent.** CC1 identifies the P3 Phase 3 FTE arithmetic error (D-7) and CC2 identifies the [D] flag misapplications. Neither contradicts the other. Both confirm that AL02 Phase 3 is the most significant divergence point in the dataset.
  3. **CC2 and CC3 findings reinforce each other.** CC2 validates the +0.9 systematic divergence claim for P2 Phase 3. CC3 independently identifies AL02 and AL09 as the most structurally problematic cross-phase trajectories. Both converge on P2 Phase 3 as the most analytically complex area of the ratings framework.
  4. **CC4 and CC5 findings are complementary.** CC4 identifies DS9 FTE carry-over as a scope inconsistency (2.0-3.25 FTE derived under ISV-manages-GPU assumptions not recomputed for customer-owns-GPU scope). CC5 does not address this specific issue but its talent acquisition gap applies to the broader FTE figures including DS9.
  5. **Alignment with cumulative findings from prior waves:** CC1 confirms the RP3d finding on P3 FTE understatement. CC2 confirms the RP3b finding on DS10 [D] flag misapplication and extends it with two newly identified AL10 misapplications. CC3 finds no contradiction with prior wave findings. CC4's DS9 finding extends prior wave scope analysis. CC5's gaps are genuinely new contributions not previously identified in waves 1-5 review work.
  6. **Phase 3 TE systematic understatement:** CC1 (P3 FTE arithmetic), CC2 (P2 systematic divergence), and CC5 (missing coordination overhead, talent constraints) all converge on the conclusion that Phase 3 ongoing effort is systematically understated in the ratings framework — through arithmetic error (CC1), divergence masking (CC2), and absent cost categories (CC5). This is the strongest cross-file signal.
- **Spot-check results:** 5/5 verified. All five files had at least one specific claim independently verified against the ratings file or external sources. No spot-check failures detected.

## Reviewer Notes

The Wave 6 cross-cutting analysis is high quality. All five agents operated within their assigned scope boundaries, produced rigorous analysis with proper citation, and generated findings that are mutually consistent and complementary. The most significant findings across the five files are:

1. **P3 Phase 3 FTE is materially understated** (CC1, D-7): stated "~10-18 FTE" should be 11.85-19.55 FTE, propagating to a corrected Phase 3 grand total of ~51-95 FTE (vs. stated ~49-93 FTE).
2. **Three of four [D] flags are misapplied** (CC2): only AL02 Phase 3 (gap +3) correctly meets the stated 2+ threshold. AL10 Phase 1, AL10 Phase 3, and DS10 Phase 3 all have gaps of +1.
3. **AL09 is the only subsegment where Phase 3 RD exceeds Phase 1 RD** (CC3): a structurally unusual trajectory justified by AI ecosystem velocity but lacking an explanatory note for the asymmetry.
4. **DS9 FTE not recomputed for customer-owns-GPU scope** (CC4): the 2.0-3.25 FTE figure was derived under ISV-manages-GPU assumptions and should be reduced to approximately 0.5-1.0 FTE.
5. **Six structurally absent risk categories** (CC5): organizational change management, customer communication overhead, vendor lock-in reversal, supply chain security, talent acquisition, and regulatory variance are genuine gaps in the framework.

No rework is required for any file. The three minor issues identified (CC2 averaging methodology, CC3 table drafting artifacts, CC4 filename typo) are all low-severity and do not affect the validity of any finding.
