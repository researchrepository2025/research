# Research Results: Future State of Enterprise AI Development & Emerging Enablers

**Research Query**: Query 13 - Future State of Enterprise AI Development
**Research Date**: November 21, 2025 (Updated: November 22, 2025)
**Query Focus**: What would truly easy enterprise AI development look like in 2-5 years, including enabling technologies, barriers, and preparation strategies

---

## Executive Summary

This research examines what truly easy enterprise AI development would look like in the 2-5 year timeframe, grounded in documented evidence from McKinsey, BCG, Forrester, IDC, Stanford HAI, and other authoritative sources. Key findings reveal a significant gap between current adoption (88% of organizations using AI) and enterprise-wide value creation (only 6% achieving significant EBIT impact). While AI development costs have dropped dramatically (280x reduction in inference costs since 2022), barriers around data quality, integration complexity, and talent shortages persist. Emerging technologies including AI agents, efficient small language models, and natural language interfaces are beginning to enable democratized AI development, though full realization of "truly easy" enterprise AI remains 3-5 years away based on analyst forecasts.

- AI high performers invest >20% of digital budgets in AI, according to [McKinsey 2025](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/quantumblack/our-insights/the-state-of-ai)
- Leading companies allocate 80%+ of AI investments to reshaping functions and inventing new offerings, according to [BCG 2025](https://www.bcg.com/publications/2025/closing-the-ai-impact-gap)
- According to [IBM's 2025 reports](https://www.ibm.com/think/insights/enterprise-transformation-extreme-productivity-ai), IBM is on track to reach $4.5B in productivity savings by end of 2025 through AI transformation

**THE GAP**:
- According to [Informatica's CDO Insights 2025](https://www.informatica.com/blogs/cdo-insights-2025-global-data-leaders-racing-ahead-despite-headwinds-to-being-ai-ready-latest-survey-finds.html), 92% of data leaders are concerned they're accelerating AI adoption despite underlying data problems
- Only 46% of organizations integrate workforce planning into AI roadmaps, according to [WEF 2025](https://www.weforum.org/publications/the-future-of-jobs-report-2025/digest/)
- According to [Forrester's 2026 Predictions](https://www.forrester.com/predictions/), fewer than one-third of decision-makers can tie AI value to financial growth

**PATH FORWARD**:
- Conduct formal strategy assessment identifying AI opportunities across cost reduction, value creation, and business model innovation
- Build hybrid AI networks combining external AI labs with internal team upskilling
- Manage AI like a transformation with clear outcomes and rigorous value tracking, according to [BCG 2025](https://www.bcg.com/publications/2025/closing-the-ai-impact-gap)

### 5.2 The Journey to Easy - Maturity Framework

**Published Maturity Models**:

**McKinsey AI Readiness Index** - Five dimensions:
1. Strategy - AI vision and roadmap alignment
2. Data - Quality, accessibility, governance
3. Technology - Infrastructure and tooling
4. Organization - Structure and processes
5. Capabilities - Skills and talent

**Deloitte Maturity Model**:
- **Starters**: Isolated AI projects without coordination
- **Pathseekers**: Several AI initiatives with mixed value impact
- **Transformers**: Scale AI with strong ROI and embedded governance
- **High-outcome organizations**: Enterprise-wide value including new markets

**BCG "Deploy, Reshape, Invent" Framework**:
- **Deploy**: Off-the-shelf tools for 10-15% productivity boost
- **Reshape**: Workflow re-engineering for 30-50% improvements
- **Invent**: AI for new revenue streams and business models

**Success Characteristics from Research**:
- 55% of high performers fundamentally rework processes when deploying AI - 3x the rate of others, according to [McKinsey 2025](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/quantumblack/our-insights/the-state-of-ai)
- Nearly half of respondents in high-performing firms strongly agree senior leaders show clear AI ownership and long-term commitment - vs 16% elsewhere, according to [McKinsey 2025](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/quantumblack/our-insights/the-state-of-ai)
- High performers use AI across more business functions than peers, especially in marketing/sales, strategy/finance, and product development

## Gaps and Limitations of This Research

### Information Gaps Identified

1. **Specific enterprise case studies with quantified outcomes**: While platform comparisons exist, detailed case studies with measurable business results from specific named enterprises are limited in publicly available sources.

2. **Long-term ROI data**: Most available data covers 1-2 year timeframes; 5+ year longitudinal studies on enterprise AI ROI are scarce.

3. **Failure case analysis**: While failure rates are well-documented (42-80%), detailed analysis of why specific enterprise AI projects failed is less available in public sources.

4. **Regional variation**: Most data focuses on US and Europe; enterprise AI adoption patterns in emerging markets are less documented.

5. **Small and medium enterprise data**: Most research focuses on large enterprises; SME-specific AI adoption and success data is limited.

### Methodology Limitations

1. **Survey-based data**: Many statistics derive from self-reported surveys, which may include response bias.

2. **Vendor-sponsored research**: Some studies are sponsored by vendors with potential conflicts of interest (noted where identified).

3. **Rapidly evolving field**: Data from even 12 months ago may not reflect current state; sources prioritized from 2025.

4. **Forecast uncertainty**: Analyst predictions vary significantly and have mixed track records; forecasts should be treated as directional rather than precise.

### Sources Explicitly Excluded

Per research guidelines, Gartner sources were excluded from this research. Some statistics commonly attributed to Gartner are referenced as "industry research" when corroborated by multiple sources.
