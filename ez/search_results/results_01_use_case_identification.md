## Executive Summary

This research examines what effortless AI use case identification would look like, documents current barriers preventing easy identification, catalogs emerging solutions (2025), and establishes benchmarks for measuring success. The findings reveal a significant gap between AI adoption (88% of organizations in 2025) and value realization (only 6% achieving transformative results). Key insights include:

- **Failure rates remain high**: 70-85% of AI projects fail to meet ROI expectations; 95% of enterprise AI pilots show no measurable P&L impact ([MIT NANDA "The GenAI Divide" 2025](https://fortune.com/2025/08/18/mit-report-95-percent-generative-ai-pilots-at-companies-failing-cfo/))
- **Leaders differentiate through process, not technology**: Top performers allocate 10% to algorithms, 20% to technology/data, and 70% to people and processes ([BCG "From Potential to Profit" January 2025](https://www.bcg.com/publications/2025/closing-the-ai-impact-gap))
- **Buy vs. build matters**: Purchased solutions succeed 67% of the time vs. 33% for internal builds ([MIT NANDA 2025](https://fortune.com/2025/08/18/mit-report-95-percent-generative-ai-pilots-at-companies-failing-cfo/))
- **Project abandonment rising**: 42% of companies abandoned most of their AI initiatives in 2025, up from 17% in 2024 ([S&P Global Voice of the Enterprise 2025](https://www.ciodive.com/news/AI-project-fail-data-SPGlobal/742590/))
- **Best-in-class examples exist**: JPMorgan (600+ use cases), DBS Bank (370+ use cases), and Michelin (200+ use cases) demonstrate scalable approaches

## Section 1: What Would Effortless AI Use Case Identification Look Like?

### 1.1 What Would Effortless AI Use Case Discovery Look Like?

**THE IDEAL**:
Effortless AI use case discovery would feature a systematic, organization-wide process that automatically surfaces high-value opportunities by analyzing operational data, workflow patterns, and business metrics. It would include standardized evaluation criteria, real-time prioritization scoring, and seamless integration with strategic planning cycles. Discovery would be continuous rather than episodic, with AI-powered tools identifying opportunities faster than human analysis alone.

**CLOSEST ACHIEVED**:
- **Organization**: DBS Bank (Singapore)
- **Specific achievements**:
  - Deployed 370+ distinct AI use cases powered by 1,500+ AI/ML models
  - Reduced AI project timelines from 15 months to under 3 months through reusable model components and templates
  - Developed proprietary ADA and ALAN platforms forming an "AI factory" designed for scale and efficiency
- **Measurable outcomes**:
  - SGD 1 billion (approximately US$750 million) economic impact expected in 2025 from AI adoption
  - 15% savings of customers' money from fraud through AI/ML flagging high-risk transactions in under 10 milliseconds
  - Named "World's Best AI Bank" by Global Finance in 2025

**THE GAP**:
- **What remains unachieved**: Fully automated use case discovery with real-time prioritization remains elusive; most organizations still rely on manual ideation workshops
- **Technical reasons**: Integration complexity between discovery tools and enterprise systems; lack of standardized data formats for cross-functional analysis
- **Organizational reasons**: Siloed departments with different priorities; lack of centralized visibility into all business processes
- **Market maturity reasons**: Use case discovery tools are nascent; most focus on implementation rather than discovery
- **Source**: Researcher synthesis from multiple sources

**PATH FORWARD**:
- Development of AI-powered discovery platforms that analyze enterprise data patterns to suggest use cases
- Standardization of use case evaluation frameworks across industries
- Integration of discovery tools with enterprise architecture platforms
- **Emerging developments**: Low-code AI platforms reducing time-to-market by up to 70%; AI agent frameworks enabling automated process analysis; 55% of developers planning to build complex agentic workflows in 2025

### 1.2 What Would a Seamless AI Opportunity Discovery Process Look Like?

**THE IDEAL**:
A seamless AI opportunity discovery process would involve continuous scanning of business operations, automatic identification of automation candidates, real-time ROI projections, and immediate handoff to implementation teams with clear success criteria. It would eliminate the typical 6-12 month discovery phase, replacing it with always-on identification.

- **Technical reasons**: Complexity of evaluating use cases across diverse banking functions; need for specialized domain expertise
- **Organizational reasons**: Risk and compliance requirements necessitate centralized oversight
- **Source**: [Tearsheet, "JPMorgan Chase's Gen AI implementation"](https://tearsheet.co/artificial-intelligence/jpmorgan-chases-gen-ai-implementation-450-use-cases-and-lessons-learned/)

### 1.3 What Would Ideal ROI Calculation for AI Investments Look Like?

**THE IDEAL**:
Ideal ROI calculation would feature standardized metrics accepted across industries, real-time tracking dashboards, automated data collection eliminating manual reporting, and predictive models that forecast ROI with high accuracy before implementation begins.

  - 60% of companies surveyed are failing to define and monitor any financial KPIs related to AI value creation ([BCG January 2025](https://www.bcg.com/publications/2025/closing-the-ai-impact-gap))
- **Technical reasons**: Difficulty isolating AI contribution from other factors; lack of standardized measurement tools
- **Organizational reasons**: Finance teams lack AI literacy; AI teams lack financial acumen
- **Source**: [Writer "2025 Enterprise AI Adoption Survey" March 2025](https://writer.com/blog/enterprise-ai-adoption-survey/)

2. **Industry-specific success rates**: Most research aggregates across industries; sector-specific failure rates less documented

3. **Long-term ROI tracking**: Most studies report initial ROI; multi-year sustained value data limited

4. **SME vs. enterprise differences**: Research heavily skewed toward large enterprises; SME experiences underrepresented

5. **Geographic variation**: Most research U.S./Europe-centric; limited data from emerging markets (except DBS in Asia)

### Notes on Source Dates

1. **IDC AI Opportunity Study**: The most recent publicly available report is from November 2024. ROI figures ($3.70 average, $10.30 top performers) are from this edition.
