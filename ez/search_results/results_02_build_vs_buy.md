## Executive Summary

This research examines the enterprise AI build vs. buy decision landscape for 2025. Key findings indicate that while [88% of organizations now regularly use AI in at least one business function](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/quantumblack/our-insights/the-state-of-ai) (McKinsey, 2025), only 6% have achieved significant enterprise-level EBIT impact. Failure rates remain stubbornly high, with [42% of enterprises abandoning most AI initiatives in 2025](https://www.spglobal.com/market-intelligence/en/news-insights/research/ai-experiences-rapid-adoption-but-with-mixed-outcomes-highlights-from-vote-ai-machine-learning) (S&P Global, 2025), up from 17% in 2024. According to [MIT's NANDA Initiative](https://fortune.com/2025/08/18/mit-report-95-percent-generative-ai-pilots-at-companies-failing-cfo/), purchasing AI solutions from specialized vendors succeeds approximately 67% of the time, while internal builds succeed only one-third as often. Organizations achieving AI value share common characteristics: executive sponsorship, workflow redesign, and a hybrid build/buy approach following an approximate 80/20 model favoring purchased solutions for routine applications.

## Section 1: The Ideal State - Clear, Confident Build vs. Buy Decisions

### 1.1 What Would a Simple, Reliable Decision Framework Look Like?

**THE IDEAL:**
A simple, reliable AI build vs. buy decision framework would provide:
- Clear, quantifiable criteria with objective scoring thresholds
- TCO calculators that accurately predict 3-5 year costs within 10% variance
- Organizational readiness assessments that reliably predict success probability
- Decision trees that account for data maturity, talent availability, integration complexity, and strategic differentiation
- Built-in governance checkpoints aligned with emerging regulatory requirements
- Documented decision paths that can be audited and justified to stakeholders

**CLOSEST ACHIEVED:**

According to [McKinsey's State of AI 2025 report](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/quantumblack/our-insights/the-state-of-ai), the AI Readiness Index evaluates organizational preparedness based on five critical dimensions: strategy, data, technology, organization, and capabilities. The survey of 1,993 participants conducted June-July 2025 found that 88% of organizations now regularly use AI, yet nearly two-thirds have not begun scaling AI across the enterprise.

The [AI Maturity Assessment and Alignment (AIMAA) framework](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/388678591_AI_Maturity_Assessment_and_Alignment_AIMAA) published in 2025 integrates strategic, technical, and operational dimensions to holistically measure AI adoption, addressing gaps in existing models.

According to [MarkTechPost's 2025 analysis](https://www.marktechpost.com/2025/08/24/build-vs-buy-for-enterprise-ai-2025/), for most enterprise use cases in 2025, experts recommend a "blend" approach: pair proven vendor platforms (multi-model routing, safety layers, compliance artifacts) with custom "last mile" work on prompts, retrieval, orchestration, and domain evaluations.

**THE GAP:**
- No single, universally adopted decision framework exists that has been validated across industries with documented success rates
- Existing frameworks (McKinsey, BCG, Deloitte) are qualitative assessment tools rather than prescriptive decision engines
- Most frameworks lack quantitative thresholds or scoring systems that produce confident, repeatable decisions
- According to [Xenoss's 2025 TCO analysis](https://xenoss.io/blog/total-cost-of-ownership-for-enterprise-ai), 85% of organizations misestimate AI project costs by more than 10%

**PATH FORWARD:**
- Development of industry-specific decision frameworks with validated success metrics
- Integration of TCO calculators directly into decision frameworks
- Creation of decision support tools that incorporate real-time market data on vendor capabilities and pricing
- Standardization of AI readiness assessment criteria across consulting frameworks

---

### 1.2 What Would TCO Transparency Look Like?

**THE IDEAL:**
TCO transparency would mean:
- Pre-implementation cost estimates accurate within 10-15% of actual costs
- Comprehensive cost models that capture all seven hidden cost categories (infrastructure, integration, maintenance, training, compliance, model drift, and opportunity costs)
- Standardized TCO benchmarks by industry, use case, and organization size
- Real-time cost monitoring dashboards with predictive variance alerts
- Clear breakdown of build vs. buy cost trajectories over 3-5 year horizons

**CLOSEST ACHIEVED:**

[Forrester's Total Economic Impact (TEI) methodology](https://www.forrester.com/policies/tei/) consists of four components to evaluate investment value: cost, benefits, flexibility, and risk. It is a proven industry-standard framework that models all aspects of a technology solution and has been applied to multiple AI implementations in 2025, including [Microsoft 365 Copilot](https://tei.forrester.com/go/microsoft/M365Copilot/?lang=en-us) and [Five9 AI-Powered CX](https://www.five9.com/resources/study/forrester-TEI).

**THE GAP:**

According to [Agent Mode AI's 2025 CFO guide](https://agentmodeai.com/the-hidden-costs-of-agentic-ai-a-cfos-guide-to-true-tco-and-roi-modeling/), 73% of enterprises diving into AI transformation don't understand the true total cost of ownership. Vendors omit seven categories of hidden costs that comprise 70% of actual AI investment.

[Xenoss's 2025 enterprise AI TCO analysis](https://xenoss.io/blog/total-cost-of-ownership-for-enterprise-ai) reports that 85% of organizations misestimate AI project costs by more than 10%, and 80% of enterprises miss AI infrastructure forecasts by 25%.

According to [Agentive AIQ's 2025 cost analysis](https://agentiveaiq.com/blog/how-much-does-an-ai-chatbot-cost-in-2025), enterprises spend 15-20% of initial cost annually on AI maintenance - often exceeding initial build costs over five years. Integration complexity eats 18% of the budget on average.

**PATH FORWARD:**
- Development of standardized TCO templates that capture all hidden cost categories
- Creation of industry benchmarking databases with actual vs. estimated costs
- Implementation of real-time cost tracking integrated with AI platform dashboards
- Regulatory requirements for vendor cost disclosure transparency

---

### 1.3 What Would Organizational Readiness Look Like?

**THE IDEAL:**
Organizational readiness would manifest as:
- Validated assessment tools that predict AI project success with >80% accuracy
- Clear data maturity thresholds for build vs. buy decisions
- Talent gap analysis tools with remediation timelines
- Cultural readiness indicators that account for change management requirements
- Governance frameworks aligned with emerging AI regulations (EU AI Act, etc.)

**CLOSEST ACHIEVED:**

According to [McKinsey's State of AI 2025](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/quantumblack/our-insights/the-state-of-ai), almost all companies invest in AI, but just 1% believe they are at maturity.

[Harvard Business Review's 2025 research on AI organizational barriers](https://hbr.org/2025/11/overcoming-the-organizational-barriers-to-ai-adoption) found that nearly two-thirds of respondents said AI adoption is a mid-level or top strategic priority, but only 10% feel their organizations are "completely ready" to adopt AI. Nearly all respondents (91%) agree that having a reliable data foundation is essential.

[Deloitte's 2025 AI Board Governance Roadmap](https://www.deloitte.com/us/en/programs/center-for-board-effectiveness/articles/board-of-directors-governance-framework-artificial-intelligence.html) provides organizations with a structured framework for AI governance. Their 2025 Global Boardroom Survey of 700 board directors found that 31% of organizations are not ready to deploy AI.

According to [DBS Bank's case study](https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/Harvard_Business_School_examines_DBS_AI_strategy) documented by Harvard Business School in 2025, the bank deploys over 1,500 AI models across 370 use cases, projecting economic impact exceeding SGD 1 billion in 2025. In 2023, DBS ranked #1 for AI Strategy Leadership in Global Evident AI Index.

**THE GAP:**

According to [Informatica's CDO Insights 2025 Survey](https://www.informatica.com/blogs/cdo-insights-2025-global-data-leaders-racing-ahead-despite-headwinds-to-being-ai-ready-latest-survey-finds.html) of 600 CDOs, 67% of organizations are struggling to transition GenAI pilots to production. 43% of data leaders say that data quality, completeness and readiness are among the biggest obstacles.

The same survey found that 97% of organizations using or planning to use AI find it difficult to demonstrate business value because of data and organizational readiness limitations. The average time data leaders estimate to get employees trained on responsible GenAI use is 11 months.

**PATH FORWARD:**
- Standardization of readiness assessment criteria across industries
- Development of validated predictive models for AI project success based on readiness scores
- Integration of change management readiness into technical assessments
- Creation of regulatory compliance readiness checklists aligned with EU AI Act and emerging US regulations

## Section 2: What Makes It Hard Today - Barriers to Easy Build vs. Buy Decisions

### 2.1 Why Is the Build Path So Risky?

According to [MIT's NANDA Initiative "The GenAI Divide" report](https://fortune.com/2025/08/18/mit-report-95-percent-generative-ai-pilots-at-companies-failing-cfo/) (August 2025), 95% of enterprise gen-AI pilots fail to deliver measurable P&L impact - mostly due to integration, data, and governance gaps, not model capability. This research was based on 150 interviews, survey of 350 employees, and analysis of 300 public AI deployments.

According to [S&P Global Market Intelligence's "Voice of the Enterprise: AI & Machine Learning, Use Cases 2025"](https://www.spglobal.com/market-intelligence/en/news-insights/research/ai-experiences-rapid-adoption-but-with-mixed-outcomes-highlights-from-vote-ai-machine-learning) survey of 1,006 IT professionals across North America and Europe, the share of companies abandoning most of their AI initiatives jumped to 42% in 2025, up from 17% in 2024. The average organization scrapped 46% of AI proof-of-concepts before they reached production.

**Root Causes of Build Failure:**

Based on RAND Corporation research (interviews with 65 data scientists and engineers), which continues to be cited in [2025 industry analyses](https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RRA2680-1.html):
1. Industry stakeholders often misunderstand or miscommunicate what problem needs to be solved using AI
2. Organizations lack necessary data to adequately train an effective AI model
3. Organizations focus more on using latest technology than solving real problems
4. Organizations lack adequate infrastructure to manage data and deploy completed AI models
5. Technology is applied to problems that are too difficult for AI to solve

**Talent Shortage Statistics:**

According to [PwC's 2025 Global AI Jobs Barometer](https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/issues/artificial-intelligence/ai-jobs-barometer.html), AI-skilled workers see an average 56% wage premium in 2025, double the 25% premium from the previous year. Jobs requiring AI skills are growing 7.5% while total job postings fell 11.3%.

According to [Capgemini's World Quality Report 2025](https://www.capgemini.com/news/press-releases/world-quality-report-2025-ai-adoption-surges-in-quality-engineering-but-enterprise-level-scaling-remains-elusive/), 50% of organizations report lacking AI/ML expertise, unchanged from 2024.

---

### 2.2 Why Is the Buy Path Full of Surprises?

**Hidden Costs:**

According to [Agentive AIQ's 2025 cost analysis](https://agentiveaiq.com/blog/how-much-does-an-ai-chatbot-cost-in-2025), enterprises spend 15-20% annually on maintenance alone - more than the original build cost over five years. Custom LLM-powered chatbots can exceed $250,000, with medical and financial bots running 25-35% higher due to regulatory needs.

One healthcare startup reported $120,000 in additional compliance costs just to meet HIPAA standards - nearly half their total budget. SOC 2 audits can cost $25,000-$75,000.

According to [Agent Mode AI's 2025 analysis](https://agentmodeai.com/the-hidden-costs-of-agentic-ai-a-cfos-guide-to-true-tco-and-roi-modeling/), inference workloads often drive "cloud bill shocks," with costs spiking 5-10x due to idle GPU instances or overprovisioning. 84% of companies see 6%+ gross margin erosion due to AI infrastructure costs.

**Integration Challenges:**

According to a [2025 survey on AI Agent Development Strategies](https://www.architectureandgovernance.com/artificial-intelligence/new-research-uncovers-top-challenges-in-enterprise-ai-agent-adoption/), 42% of enterprises need access to eight or more data sources to deploy AI agents successfully. More than 86% of enterprises require upgrades to their existing tech stack to deploy AI agents.

According to [Capgemini's World Quality Report 2025](https://www.capgemini.com/news/press-releases/world-quality-report-2025-ai-adoption-surges-in-quality-engineering-but-enterprise-level-scaling-remains-elusive/), top challenges include integration complexity (64%), data privacy risks (67%), and hallucination/reliability concerns (60%).

**Notable Vendor Failures (Historical Context):**

McDonald's ended its two-year AI drive-thru test with IBM in June 2024, removing the technology from more than 100 restaurants. According to [CNBC reporting](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/17/mcdonalds-to-end-ibm-ai-drive-thru-test.html), accuracy remained "in the low-to-mid 80% range" while operating costs were high. Franchisees indicated it would "have to be at least 95% accurate" to be viable.

MD Anderson Cancer Center's Watson project was terminated after 4 years and $62 million in costs. According to [IEEE Spectrum's analysis](https://spectrum.ieee.org/how-ibm-watson-overpromised-and-underdelivered-on-ai-health-care), the system was never used on actual patients.

**Vendor Lock-in Concerns:**

According to [Forrester's 2025 Predictions](https://www.forrester.com/blogs/predictions-2025-technology-infrastructure-operations/), a major tech vendor (Microsoft, Oracle, Amazon, or IBM) will reduce AI infrastructure investments by 25% in 2025 due to gap between investment and returns. When only 25% of decision-makers see measurable benefits, companies are reassessing overly ambitious plans.

---

### 2.3 Why Is TCO So Hard to Calculate Accurately?

**Commonly Underestimated Components:**

According to [Xenoss's 2025 TCO analysis](https://xenoss.io/blog/total-cost-of-ownership-for-enterprise-ai), model drift causes performance degradation requiring retraining and revalidation, consuming an additional 15-25% of compute overhead.

**Cost Variance Statistics:**

According to [IBM's 2025 AI Cost Governance study](https://www.mavvrik.ai/state-of-ai-cost-governance-report/), every respondent said they had cancelled or postponed at least one GenAI project due to rising compute expenses. 73% plan to implement centralized monitoring solutions.

According to [industry data compiled in 2025](https://markaicode.com/cloud-vs-local-ai-cost-comparison/), compared to 2024, the cost to access computer capacity for training AI models has risen sharply. One year ago, just 8% of IT leaders noted these costs were too high. Today, that number has increased to 42% - a 34-point jump. As of 2025, renting an NVIDIA H100 GPU in the cloud costs $0.58-$8.54 per hour or $5,000-$75,000 per year if used continuously.

## Section 3: Evidence of What "Easy" Looks Like - Case Studies of Success

### 3.1 What Does a Successful Build Decision Look Like in Practice?

**THE IDEAL:**
A successful build decision would feature:
- Clear strategic rationale tied to competitive differentiation
- Accurate cost and timeline forecasts within 15% variance
- Measurable ROI demonstrated within 12-18 months
- Sustainable internal capability development
- Technology that adapts to evolving business needs

**CLOSEST ACHIEVED:**

According to [Walmart's 2025 supply chain reports](https://logisticsviewpoints.com/2025/03/19/walmart-and-the-new-supply-chain-reality-ai-automation-and-resilience/), their Self-Healing Inventory AI system alone has already saved more than $55 million. Through AI optimization, they avoided 94 million pounds of CO2 by eliminating 30 million unnecessary miles driven. Delivery costs per order have dropped by 40%, while 45% of e-commerce orders now arrive in under an hour.

According to [BMW case studies from 2025](https://chiefaiofficer.com/blog/the-bmw-ai-strategy-that-catches-defects-before-humans-can-see-them/), their AI-powered computer vision for assembly line inspections has achieved up to 60% reduction in vehicle defects. The AIQX (Artificial Intelligence Quality Next) system uses sensor technology and AI to automate quality processes in real-time.

According to JPMorgan case studies documented in [2025](https://digitaldefynd.com/IQ/jp-morgan-using-ai-case-study/), their COIN (Contract Intelligence) system performs the equivalent of 360,000 staff hours annually - over 40 years of manual work - in seconds.

According to [MIT Sloan Management Review's August 2025 feature](https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/accelerating-manufacturing-innovation-at-michelin-with-data-and-ai/), Michelin Group has more than 200 AI use cases across quality control, inventory management, and predictive modeling. AI-driven productivity improvements now generate more than 50 million euros in ROI per year, with growth rate increase approaching 30-40% annually.

**THE GAP:**
- These success stories represent a small percentage (approximately 5%) of enterprise AI initiatives
- Most documented successes are from large enterprises with substantial resources
- Few case studies document the full decision-making process that led to choosing build over buy
- Limited data on mid-market companies successfully building AI capabilities

**PATH FORWARD:**
- Development of case study repositories documenting decision criteria, not just outcomes
- Creation of industry-specific build playbooks based on successful implementations
- Establishment of peer networks for sharing lessons learned

---

### 3.2 What Does a Successful Buy Decision Look Like in Practice?

**THE IDEAL:**
A successful buy decision would feature:
- Rapid time-to-value (under 6 months to production)
- Smooth integration with existing systems
- Predictable costs aligned with initial estimates
- Vendor responsiveness to customization needs
- Clear upgrade paths and minimal lock-in

**CLOSEST ACHIEVED:**

According to [Klarna's 2025 updates](https://www.customerexperiencedive.com/news/klarna-says-ai-agent-work-853-employees/805987/), their AI assistant now does the work of more than 853 full-time agents (up from 700 at launch), saving $60 million. The AI handles approximately two-thirds of all customer inquiries, improved response times by 82%, and decreased repeat issues by 25% since launch. Customer satisfaction with the AI assistant is "on-par" with a human agent.

According to [Wells Fargo case studies from 2025](https://www.ninetwothree.co/blog/ai-adoption-case-studies), the bank achieved 245 million interactions without human handoffs using AI agents.

According to [MIT's NANDA Initiative 2025 research](https://fortune.com/2025/08/18/mit-report-95-percent-generative-ai-pilots-at-companies-failing-cfo/), purchasing AI tools from specialized vendors and building partnerships succeed about 67% of the time, while internal builds succeed only one-third as often.

**THE GAP:**
- "Smooth" implementations are rare; most vendor implementations encounter unexpected challenges
- Integration with legacy systems remains a consistent friction point
- Vendor AI capabilities often require significant customization for enterprise contexts
- Limited documentation of buy decision criteria that led to successful outcomes

**PATH FORWARD:**
- Vendor certification programs for enterprise readiness
- Standardized integration requirements and API specifications
- Development of vendor selection frameworks with validated criteria

---

### 3.3 What Do We Learn From Failures and Pivots?

According to [IEEE Spectrum's IBM Watson analysis](https://spectrum.ieee.org/how-ibm-watson-overpromised-and-underdelivered-on-ai-health-care), MD Anderson's $62 million IBM Watson failure demonstrated that "solving data quality problems in unstructured data is a much bigger challenge for artificial intelligence than was first anticipated." IBM "didn't quite understand the complexity of health records, especially the fact that the majority of them are on paper, and that they're all recorded differently."

According to [CNBC reporting](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/17/mcdonalds-to-end-ibm-ai-drive-thru-test.html) on McDonald's IBM AI drive-thru failure, accuracy must be "at least 95% accurate and will have to save [franchisees] money over having a person in the drive through, and the way it is designed now, does neither."

According to [MIT's NANDA 2025 research](https://fortune.com/2025/08/18/mit-report-95-percent-generative-ai-pilots-at-companies-failing-cfo/), "Almost everywhere we went, enterprises were trying to build their own tool," but the data showed purchased solutions delivered more reliable results.

**Key Lessons from Failures:**

1. **Data readiness is non-negotiable:** Organizations with successful AI implementations spend 50-70% of timeline and budget on data readiness
2. **Workflow redesign precedes technology:** [McKinsey's 2025 survey](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/quantumblack/our-insights/the-state-of-ai) shows the 6% of AI high performers are 3x more likely to redesign workflows rather than just adding AI to existing processes
3. **Executive sponsorship is critical:** McKinsey found high performers are 3x more likely than peers to have senior leaders demonstrate ownership of AI initiatives
4. **Realistic expectations matter:** The MIT NANDA research identifies inability of AI systems to retain data, adapt, and learn over time as core barriers to scaling

---

## Section 4: What Would a Clear Vendor Landscape Look Like?

### 4.1 What Does the Current Vendor Landscape Look Like?

**Market Size and Growth:**

According to [IDC's 2025 forecasts](https://my.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS52530724), global enterprises will invest $307 billion on AI solutions in 2025, expected to reach $632 billion by 2028, fueled by ~30% CAGR.

According to [IDC's AI Infrastructure projections](https://my.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS53894425), the global AI infrastructure market is projected to reach $758 billion by 2029.

According to [IDC FutureScape 2025](https://my.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=US51666724), enterprises will drive 67% of the forecast $337 billion global AI spend in 2025.

**Forrester Wave Evaluations:**

According to [Forrester Wave: AI Decisioning Platforms, Q2 2025](https://www.fico.com/en/forrester-wave-ai-decisioning-platforms), FICO is recognized as a Leader with top score in current offering category. [IBM was also named a Leader](https://www.ibm.com/new/announcements/ibm-named-a-leader-in-the-forrester-wave-ai-decisioning-platforms-q2-2025) in the same evaluation.

---

### 4.2 What Would an Ideal Hybrid Approach Look Like?

**THE IDEAL:**
An ideal hybrid approach would:
- Clearly delineate which capabilities to build (strategic differentiation) vs. buy (commodity functions)
- Provide modular architecture allowing easy substitution of vendor components
- Enable rapid experimentation while maintaining production stability
- Balance cost optimization with capability development
- Maintain optionality and minimize lock-in

**CLOSEST ACHIEVED:**

According to [industry analysis from 2025](https://www.ai.work/blog/enterprise-ai-in-2025-an-80-20-balance-of-buy-vs-build), industry consensus points to an 80/20 rule: 80% of AI needs met by purchased solutions, 20% addressed with custom-built AI where deep integration or unique IP is critical.

According to [PwC's May 2025 AI Agent Survey](https://www.pwc.com/us/en/tech-effect/ai-analytics/ai-agent-survey.html), 79% of companies say AI agents are already being adopted, and 71% of active adopters of agentic AI are choosing to build solutions in-house while 43% are opting for off-the-shelf purchases, indicating hybrid approaches are common.

According to [a16z's 2025 Enterprise AI Survey](https://a16z.com/ai-enterprise-2025/) of 100 CIOs across 15 industries, 37% of respondents are now using 5 or more models in production, up from 29% last year. Organizations are much more sophisticated at mixing and matching multiple models to optimize across both performance and cost.

According to [Menlo Ventures' 2025 Mid-Year LLM Update](https://menlovc.com/perspective/2025-mid-year-llm-market-update/), enterprise spending on LLM APIs more than doubled in six months - from $3.5 billion to $8.4 billion. Anthropic now leads with 32% market share, while OpenAI's share fell from 50% in 2023 to 25%.

**THE GAP:**
- No standardized framework exists for determining optimal build/buy ratios
- Most organizations lack the capability to effectively orchestrate multi-model, multi-vendor environments
- Integration complexity increases with hybrid approaches
- Governance and compliance become more complex across build and buy components

**PATH FORWARD:**
- Development of hybrid architecture reference patterns
- Creation of vendor orchestration platforms that simplify multi-model deployments
- Establishment of interoperability standards for AI components

---

### 4.3 What Would a More Navigable Future Landscape Look Like?

**THE IDEAL:**
A more navigable landscape would feature:
- Standardized vendor evaluation criteria with transparent capability benchmarks
- Clear pricing models without hidden costs
- Interoperability standards enabling vendor portability
- Mature governance frameworks aligned across vendors
- Simplified compliance pathways for regulated industries

**CLOSEST ACHIEVED:**

According to [TD Cowen research](https://www.tdsecurities.com/ca/en/not-007-but-a-new-kind-of-ai-agent), enterprise spend on agentic AI will rise from less than $1 billion in 2024 to $51.5 billion by 2028, expanding at ~150% CAGR.

According to [BCG's "The Widening AI Value Gap" September 2025 report](https://www.bcg.com/publications/2025/are-you-generating-value-from-ai-the-widening-gap), AI agents already account for about 17% of total AI value in 2025, expected to reach 29% by 2028.

According to [BCG's September 2025 research](https://www.bcg.com/press/30september2025-ai-leaders-outpace-laggards-revenue-growth-cost-savings), 5% of companies qualify as "future-built" for AI globally. 35% are "scalers" beginning to generate value. 60% are "laggards" reporting minimal gains. Future-built firms achieve 1.7x revenue growth, 3.6x three-year TSR, and 1.6x EBIT margin compared to laggards.

**Emerging Trends:**

According to [IDC FutureScape 2025](https://my.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=US51666724), AI-enabled workflows expected to rise from 3% today to 25% of all enterprise processes by end-2025.

**THE GAP:**
- Vendor consolidation and market maturity remain in early stages
- Standardization bodies have not yet established interoperability requirements
- Regulatory frameworks (EU AI Act) are still being implemented
- Many vendors engaging in "agent washing" - rebranding existing products without substantial agentic capabilities

**PATH FORWARD:**
- Industry consortium development for AI interoperability standards
- Regulatory clarity through EU AI Act implementation and potential US frameworks
- Vendor maturity improvements through market competition and customer demands

## Gaps and Limitations of This Research

### Areas Where Reliable Data Could Not Be Found:

1. **Standardized build vs. buy decision framework with validated success rates:** No single, universally adopted framework with documented outcomes exists.

2. **Comprehensive TCO benchmarks by industry and use case:** While individual case studies exist, no standardized benchmarking database is publicly available.

3. **Long-term (5+ year) cost tracking studies:** Most available data covers 1-3 year periods; longer-term TCO analysis is limited.

4. **Mid-market company AI implementation success rates:** Most documented case studies focus on large enterprises; SMB data is sparse.

5. **Vendor-specific implementation success rates by use case:** While overall statistics exist, vendor-specific performance data by use case is not publicly available.

6. **Regional variations in build vs. buy success:** Most data focuses on North America and Europe; Asia-Pacific and other regions are underrepresented.

### Conflicting Information:

1. **AI project failure rates:** Statistics range from 42% (S&P Global - project abandonment) to 95% (MIT - failing to achieve P&L impact). These variations reflect different definitions of "failure" and different measurement methodologies.

2. **Build vs. buy success rates:** MIT reports purchased solutions succeed ~67% of the time vs. ~22% for builds, but this conflicts with other sources suggesting organizations with "bespoke solutions" achieve better outcomes (McKinsey). The difference may be in defining "success" and the sophistication of organizations attempting builds.

### Methodological Notes:

- S&P Global survey: 1,006 respondents, North America and Europe, October-November 2024 (published 2025)
- MIT NANDA study: 150 interviews, 350 employee surveys, 300 public deployment analyses, August 2025
- McKinsey State of AI: 1,993 participants in 105 nations, June-July 2025
- Informatica CDO Insights: 600 CDOs globally, January 2025
- BCG surveys: Global, multiple thousand respondents, September 2025
- Capgemini World Quality Report: Published November 2025
