## Research Methodology Note

This research focused on **publicly announced, attributable sovereign AI and cloud programs** involving the three major hyperscalers (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud) plus Oracle and NVIDIA where they serve as primary infrastructure vendors.

**Inclusion criteria:**
- Government contracts or partnerships announced Feb 2025-Jan 2026
- National AI strategies with specific cloud spending tied to vendors
- Sovereign cloud infrastructure programs with AI capabilities
- Multi-year commitments to in-country data processing

**Exclusion criteria:**
- Generic cloud adoption without sovereignty requirements
- Commercial enterprise deals without government involvement
- Programs announced before Feb 2025 unless deployment occurred in window
- Vendor marketing claims without verifiable government partnerships

**Data limitations:**
- Many European countries pursuing sovereignty did not disclose specific vendor contracts
- Several national AI strategies reference cloud spending but without vendor attribution
- Contract values frequently undisclosed for security/procurement sensitivity
- Some programs involve multiple phases with staggered announcements

**Geographic coverage:**
All EU member states plus UK, Norway, Switzerland were searched. Positive findings concentrated in Western Europe (Germany, France, UK, Netherlands) and select Nordic countries (Sweden, Denmark).
