## Summary Statistics
- Quarters covered: FY2025 Q3 (Jan-Mar 2025), FY2025 Q4 (Apr-Jun 2025), FY2026 Q1 (Jul-Sep 2025), FY2026 Q2 (Oct-Dec 2025)
- Quantitative data points found: 20
- Qualitative commentary found: 13
- Total findings: 33
- Searches that returned no relevant results: None (all searches yielded contextual information)

## Key Observations

1. **No Discrete Sovereign/Government Revenue Disclosure**: Microsoft does not break out sovereign cloud, government cloud, or Azure Government revenue as separate line items in earnings reports or SEC filings.

2. **Revenue Aggregation**: Government and sovereign workloads are aggregated within broader segments:
   - "Microsoft Cloud" ($168.9B FY2025)
   - "Azure and other cloud services" ($75B+ FY2025)
   - "Intelligent Cloud" segment

3. **Qualitative Emphasis Increasing**: Executive commentary on sovereignty increased from minimal mentions in Q3 FY2025 to substantive discussion in Q1-Q2 FY2026, indicating strategic priority shift.

4. **Geographic Expansion Focus**: Microsoft emphasized expansion from 33 countries (Q1 FY2026) to investments in 7 additional countries (Q2 FY2026), with 15 countries planned for sovereign Copilot processing.

5. **Government Customer Examples**: Specific public sector deployments mentioned include:
   - Louisiana state government (Fabric)
   - NASA (35,000+ Copilot seats)
   - US Department of Interior (35,000+ Copilot seats)
   - German public sector (OpenAI for Germany via Azure)

6. **Contract Value vs Revenue**: The $3.1B GSA contract represents potential savings/spending authority, not Microsoft revenue. The $6B estimated value over 3 years suggests federal government spending on Microsoft cloud services, but does not isolate sovereign-specific workloads.

7. **Infrastructure Metrics**: Microsoft disclosed infrastructure scale (400+ datacenters, 70 regions) but did not specify sovereign-dedicated capacity.
