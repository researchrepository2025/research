## Summary Statistics

- **Quarters covered:** Q1 2025, Q2 2025, Q3 2025, Q4 2025, FY 2025
- **Quantitative data points found:** 11
- **Qualitative commentary found:** 7
- **Key finding:** Amazon does NOT break out government/sovereign cloud revenue as a separate line item in earnings reports. All AWS revenue is reported as a consolidated segment.
- **Government revenue signals:** Commentary indicates government is a material customer segment, with specific mentions of U.S. Air Force, federal agencies via OneGov, and sovereign cloud investments
- **Notable contracts/programs:**
  - $581.3M U.S. Air Force Cloud One contract (through 2028)
  - $1B GSA OneGov agreement (credits/savings through 2028)
  - €7.8B AWS European Sovereign Cloud investment
- **Searches that returned no relevant results:** None; all searches returned results, but most lacked government-specific revenue breakouts

## Key Observations

1. **No Separate Government Revenue Disclosure:** AWS reports revenue as a single consolidated segment. Government, sovereign, and public sector revenue is embedded within the total AWS figures but not disclosed separately in 10-K, 10-Q, or earnings call transcripts.

2. **Qualitative Signals Only:** Earnings calls reference government customers qualitatively (e.g., "AWS continues to earn most of the big enterprise and government transitions to cloud") but provide no revenue figures.

3. **Contract Announcements vs. Revenue:** Specific contract values (e.g., $581M Air Force, $1B OneGov credits) are disclosed in press releases and news coverage, but these are not tied to recognized revenue in quarterly earnings.

4. **Sovereign Cloud Investment:** The €7.8B European Sovereign Cloud investment signals AWS's commitment to sovereign/government workloads, particularly for EU public sector, but no revenue attribution is provided.

5. **AI Revenue Commentary:** AWS references "triple digit year over year percentage, multibillion dollar business" for generative AI but does not segment this by customer type (government vs. commercial).
