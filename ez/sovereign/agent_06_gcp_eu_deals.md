## Key Notes

**UK MoD Contract:** While the £400M UK Ministry of Defence contract was announced in September 2025, the UK is not part of the European Union as of the search period. This deal is included as it represents a significant European sovereign AI cloud contract but may be excluded if strict EU-only scope is required.

**NATO JATEC Deal:** The NATO contract is deployed in Poland (Bydgoszcz) and serves a pan-European defense organization, making it relevant for European sovereign cloud analysis even though NATO itself is a multinational entity.

**Bundeswehr Contract:** The German military contract with BWI was signed at the end of May 2025 with deployment expected by end of 2027. Contract value has not been officially disclosed but is described by critics as "worth hundreds of millions of euros" over a ten-year period.

**Poland Partnership:** The February 2025 Poland MoU represents strategic intent rather than a confirmed contract. The $5 million cyber skills commitment is confirmed, but the broader "billions of dollars" infrastructure investment is contingent on feasibility studies and has not been finalized.

**Infrastructure vs. Revenue:** The €5.5 billion Germany announcement is explicitly infrastructure investment (capex) through 2029, not recognized revenue or government contract value. It has been separated from revenue-generating deals.

## Sovereign Cloud Partnerships (Not Direct Government Contracts)

Google Cloud maintains sovereign cloud partnerships with regional operators across Europe:

- **Germany:** T-Systems (Deutsche Telekom), Schwarz Group
- **France:** Thales/S3NS
- **Italy:** Telecom Italia
- **Spain:** Minsait
- **Belgium/Luxembourg:** Clarence (Proximus/LuxConnect joint venture)

These partnerships enable sovereign cloud offerings but are not themselves government contracts. No specific contract values for these partnership arrangements were disclosed in the search period.
