## Key Observations

### Infrastructure vs. Revenue
The $50B AWS investment announced November 24, 2025 represents capital expenditure commitment to build government AI infrastructure starting in 2026. This is NOT recognized revenue and does NOT represent a contract award. It represents AWS's commitment to build 1.3 gigawatts of AI and supercomputing capacity across AWS Top Secret, AWS Secret, and AWS GovCloud (US) Regions.

### Authorization vs. Contract
The June 12, 2025 FedRAMP High and DoD IL-4/5 authorizations for Anthropic Claude and Meta Llama models represent security clearances that enable AWS to offer these AI services to government customers. These are prerequisites for future contract awards but do not themselves represent revenue.

### GSA OneGov Agreement Structure
The GSA OneGov agreement provides "up to $1 billion in direct incentive credits for cloud services, modernization support, and training" through December 31, 2028. This represents potential savings/credits rather than a fixed contract value.

### JWCC Task Order Opacity
The Department of Defense does not publicly disclose individual vendor award amounts for JWCC task orders. As of March 2025, total JWCC awards across all four vendors (AWS, Microsoft, Google, Oracle) reached $2.3 billion, but AWS-specific amounts are not disclosed.

### State/Local Government Gap
No public announcements of AWS state or local government AI cloud contracts were identified during the research period. All identified deals were federal-level.
