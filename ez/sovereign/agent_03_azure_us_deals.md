## Key Context Notes

### JWCC Program
The Department of Defense's $9 billion Joint Warfighting Cloud Capability (JWCC) program was awarded to four vendors (AWS, Google, Microsoft, Oracle) in December 2022. By June 2025, the program reached $2.7 billion in task orders across all vendors, with approximately 50% tied to unclassified work, 30% to classified efforts, and 10% to top-secret operations.

### GSA OneGov Details
The September 2025 GSA OneGov agreement includes:
- Microsoft 365 Copilot at no cost for up to 12 months for Microsoft G5 customers
- $20 million in additional support services from Microsoft
- Discounted pricing available for up to 36 months for certain products
- Federal agencies can opt-in through September 2026

The agreement represents cost savings/discounts rather than direct revenue, but reflects significant Azure Government cloud adoption.

### Authorization vs. Revenue
Many findings represent authorizations and certifications rather than discrete revenue-generating contracts. These authorizations (IL6, Top Secret, FedRAMP High, GCC-High) enable Azure AI services to be deployed across government workloads but do not represent individual contract values. They are critical enablers for sovereign AI adoption in US government agencies.
