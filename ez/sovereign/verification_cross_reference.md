## Contradictions

| Deal | Agent A Value | Agent A Source | Agent B Value | Agent B Source | Resolution Note |
|------|-------------|---------------|-------------|---------------|----------------|
| JWCC Program Total (all vendors) | $2.3B (as of Mar 2025) | Agent 01 (DefenseScoop) | $2.7B (as of Apr 2025) | Agent 03/15 (MeriTalk) | **Not a true contradiction** -- different measurement dates. Agent 15 also cites "$3B+" as of Aug 2025 (Federal News Network). Values reflect cumulative growth over time. |
| JWCC Program Total (updated) | $2.7B (Apr 2025) | Agent 15 (MeriTalk) | $3B+ (Aug 2025) | Agent 15 (Federal News Network) | **Not a contradiction** -- same agent reporting two different dates. Program spending is cumulative. |
| JWCC Ceiling | $9B | Agent 03, Agent 15 (MeriTalk, multiple) | $9B | All agents consistent | **No contradiction** -- all sources agree on $9B ceiling. |
| Gartner European Sovereign Cloud IaaS 2025 | $6.9B | Agent 12, Agent 14 (Computerworld) | $6.7B | Agent 14, Agent 16 (TechRadar) | **Minor discrepancy** -- likely rounding differences between Gartner reporting outlets. Recommend using $6.9B as sourced from Computerworld which references the primary Gartner press release. |
| Microsoft Poland Investment | PLN 2.8B (~$700M) | Agent 04 (Microsoft Poland) | $704M | Agent 11 (GovCon Exec) | **Not a true contradiction** -- currency conversion difference. PLN 2.8B converts to approximately $700-705M depending on exchange rate used. |
| DoD CDAO OpenAI Contract Date | June 17, 2025 | Agent 10, Agent 15 (Breaking Defense) | July 14, 2025 | Agent 10 (DefenseScoop) | **Partial contradiction** -- OpenAI contract was announced June 17, 2025; Anthropic, Google, and xAI contracts followed July 14, 2025. Some sources conflate these into a single announcement. |
| DoD AI Budget FY2025 (Narrow vs. Broad) | $1.8B | Agent 13 (DefenseScoop, SECDEF Austin) | $25.2B | Agent 13 (Budget analysis) | **Not a contradiction** -- two different measurement scopes. $1.8B is "explicitly for AI"; $25.2B includes all programs "incorporating AI or autonomy in just one small part." |
