## Summary Statistics

**Quarters covered:** Q1 2025, Q2 2025, Q3 2025, Q4 2025, FY 2025

**Quantitative data points found:** 19

**Qualitative commentary found:** 12

**Key Government/Sovereign Contracts Disclosed (outside earnings calls):**
- US Department of Transportation: $89M (5-year, 50,000+ employees)
- UK Ministry of Defence: £400M (sovereign cloud)
- NATO: Multimillion-pound (amount undisclosed)
- Pentagon GenAI.mil: Contract value undisclosed (3M users)
- GSA OneGov Gemini pricing: $0.47/agency through 2026

**Searches that returned no relevant results:**
- None. All searches returned results, though sovereign/government revenue is NOT broken out as a separate line item in Alphabet's financial reporting.

## Key Observations

1. **No Separate Government Revenue Disclosure**: Alphabet does not report Google Cloud government or sovereign revenue as a separate segment. All government/public sector revenue is included in the overall Google Cloud figures.

2. **Qualitative Commentary Only in Earnings**: Earnings calls and SEC filings contain qualitative mentions of government wins (e.g., US DOT) but no quantitative government-specific revenue figures.

3. **Major Government Contracts Announced Separately**: Significant government contracts (UK MoD £400M, DOT $89M, Pentagon GenAI.mil) were announced via press releases and government sources, not in earnings calls.

4. **Sovereign AI as Product Capability**: Google Distributed Cloud and Sovereign AI are positioned as product capabilities enabling on-premises/in-country deployments for regulated workloads, mentioned qualitatively in Q1 2025 context.

5. **Backlog Growth Signals Government Demand**: The massive backlog growth from $106B (Q2) to $155B (Q3) to $240B (Q4) includes government commitments, though not separately quantified.
