## Research Notes

**TED Database:** Direct site searches of ted.europa.eu returned procedural contract notices and tender documents but did not surface major cloud AI contract awards to AWS, Azure, or GCP in the target timeframe. Most award details found through broader searches and national procurement announcements.

**Spain, Italy, Netherlands:** Searches revealed significant policy initiatives, AI legislation, and sovereign cloud strategies, but no specific government contract awards to AWS, Azure, or GCP within the February 2025–January 2026 timeframe. Italy passed the first national AI law in the EU (September 2025) and authorized up to €1 billion in AI funding. Spain allocated €60M for data spaces and ~€176M through Digital Europe programs, but these are funding initiatives rather than procurement contracts.

**Nordic Countries:** Searches found market analysis and cloud adoption data but no specific government procurement awards to AWS/Azure/GCP in the target timeframe. Denmark announced a shift from Microsoft to open-source solutions in June 2025, but implementation contracts were not disclosed.

**Sovereign Cloud Emphasis:** Multiple sources indicate European governments are increasingly prioritizing sovereign cloud providers and air-gapped solutions, with major U.S. hyperscalers (AWS, Azure, Google) launching dedicated European sovereign cloud offerings to meet regulatory and data residency requirements.
