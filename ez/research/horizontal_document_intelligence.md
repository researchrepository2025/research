---

### 4.3 Hybrid Approach: OCR + LLM (Recommended)

**The 2025 Consensus:** LLMs are not a direct replacement for OCR since they are better suited for contextual analysis and post-processing. A hybrid approach, where AI-powered OCR extracts structured data and LLMs refine or classify it, ensures high accuracy without hallucinations. [Designs Valley - LLMs vs OCR 2025](https://designsvalley.com/llms-vs-ocr/)

**Why Hybrid?**
- OCR reads but doesn't understand. It has no clue what text actually means. It'll extract "$1,200 due on 12/12/2025", but it won't tell you if that's a bill, a contract clause, or something else. LLMs step in for context understanding. [Designs Valley - LLMs vs OCR 2025](https://designsvalley.com/llms-vs-ocr/)
- LLMs failed on complex images with lots of text, inconsistent formats, and handwriting. They sometimes ignored entire data fields, confused text, or made dangerous assumptions. This nondeterminism is unacceptable for business-critical processes. [Xtillion - Document Intelligence](https://www.xtillion.com/mastering-document-intelligence)

**Reference Architecture:**
1. **Document Ingestion** → 2. **OCR Layer** (Tesseract/PaddleOCR/Azure Document Intelligence) → 3. **Structured Data Extraction** → 4. **LLM Refinement** (Claude/GPT-4o/Gemini for context, validation, classification) → 5. **Downstream System Integration**

### 4.4 Document Processing Frameworks

| Framework | Language | Key Features | Best For | Source |
|-----------|----------|--------------|----------|--------|
| **LangChain** | Python, JavaScript | Document loaders, text splitters, embeddings, vector store integrations, retrieval chains | Building RAG pipelines with LLMs; flexible orchestration | [Modal Blog - 8 Top OCR Models](https://modal.com/blog/8-top-open-source-ocr-models-compared) |
| **LlamaIndex** | Python | Data connectors, index structures, query engines optimized for document retrieval | Document-centric RAG applications; semantic search over documents | Data not verified/available |
| **Unstructured.io** | Python | Preprocessing pipeline for unstructured documents; partitioning, cleaning, chunking | Preparing documents for LLM consumption; handles PDFs, images, HTML | Data not verified/available |
| **Databricks Document Intelligence** | Scala, Python | 3-5x lower cost than competitors; competitive quality with best offerings | Teams already on Databricks; cost-sensitive deployments | [Databricks Blog - Document Intelligence](https://www.databricks.com/blog/pdfs-production-announcing-state-art-document-intelligence-databricks) |

### 4.5 Vector Databases for RAG

Vector stores are specialized databases designed to store and query high-dimensional embedding vectors. In RAG systems, vector stores serve as the knowledge backbone—they enable semantic similarity search that powers contextually relevant document retrieval. [Rost Glukhov - Vector Stores for RAG](https://www.glukhov.org/post/2025/12/vector-stores-for-rag-comparison/)

| Database | Deployment | Key Strengths | Limitations | Pricing | Best For | Source |
|----------|------------|---------------|-------------|---------|----------|--------|
| **Pinecone** | Managed SaaS | Serverless autoscaling; <50ms query times; multi-region; inference capability (embedding + search + reranking in one API); low-latency at scale | Costs climb above $500/month at scale; vendor lock-in with proprietary pricing | Managed pricing (starts low, scales with usage) | Production commercial AI SaaS; teams that don't want cluster management | [Latenode - Best Vector DBs for RAG 2025](https://latenode.com/blog/best-vector-databases-for-rag-complete-2025-comparison-guide) |
| **ChromaDB** | Self-hosted / Managed | Apache 2.0 (free); fastest path to prototype; NumPy-like API; 4x faster writes/queries (2025 Rust rewrite); built-in metadata and full-text search | Not designed for 50M+ vector scale; teams outgrow and migrate to Qdrant/Pinecone/Milvus for production | Free (open-source) | Prototyping, lightweight internal tools, development speed | [Digital One Agency - Best Vector DB 2025](https://digitaloneagency.com.au/best-vector-database-for-rag-in-2025-pinecone-vs-weaviate-vs-qdrant-vs-milvus-vs-chroma/) |
| **Qdrant** | Self-hosted / Managed | Rust-based; production-grade scale; open-source (Apache 2.0) | More operational overhead than Pinecone | Free (self-hosted) or managed pricing | Teams that outgrow ChromaDB; need production scale with open-source flexibility | [Latenode - Best Vector DBs for RAG 2025](https://latenode.com/blog/best-vector-databases-for-rag-complete-2025-comparison-guide) |
| **Weaviate** | Self-hosted / Managed | GraphQL API; semantic search; open-source | Data not verified/available | Free (self-hosted) or managed pricing | Teams preferring GraphQL interfaces | [AgixTech - Pinecone vs Weaviate vs ChromaDB](https://agixtech.com/pinecone-vs-weaviate-vs-chromadb-vector-database-comparison/) |
| **Milvus** | Self-hosted / Managed | Extreme scale (billions of vectors); open-source | Complex setup; higher operational burden | Free (self-hosted) or managed pricing | Very large-scale deployments (100M+ vectors) | [Digital One Agency - Best Vector DB 2025](https://digitaloneagency.com.au/best-vector-database-for-rag-in-2025-pinecone-vs-weaviate-vs-qdrant-vs-milvus-vs-chroma/) |

**Chunking Strategy Importance:**
Your chunking strategy determines search quality more than any other factor. Too large, and you lose precision. Too small, and you lose context. [Rost Glukhov - Vector Stores for RAG](https://www.glukhov.org/post/2025/12/vector-stores-for-rag-comparison/)

**Recommendation:**
- **Prototyping:** ChromaDB provides fastest path to validation [Digital One Agency - Best Vector DB 2025](https://digitaloneagency.com.au/best-vector-database-for-rag-in-2025-pinecone-vs-weaviate-vs-qdrant-vs-milvus-vs-chroma/)
- **Production (managed):** Pinecone eliminates operational headaches [Latenode - Best Vector DBs for RAG 2025](https://latenode.com/blog/best-vector-databases-for-rag-complete-2025-comparison-guide)
- **Production (self-hosted):** Qdrant or Milvus for scale with open-source flexibility [Latenode - Best Vector DBs for RAG 2025](https://latenode.com/blog/best-vector-databases-for-rag-complete-2025-comparison-guide)

### 5.3 The Hybrid/Blended Model (Industry Best Practice)

**The 80/20 Rule:**
Industry consensus from Gartner and Deloitte suggests 80% of AI needs are met by purchased/subscription-based AI solutions, while 20% are addressed with custom-built AI where deep integration or unique IP is critical. [AI.work - Enterprise AI 2025](https://www.ai.work/blog/enterprise-ai-in-2025-an-80-20-balance-of-buy-vs-build)

**Blended Approach:**
Pair proven vendor platforms (multi-model routing, safety layers, compliance artifacts) with custom "last mile" work on prompts, retrieval, orchestration, and domain evaluations. Retain last-mile control as enterprise IP. [MarkTechPost - Build vs Buy 2025](https://www.marktechpost.com/2025/08/24/build-vs-buy-for-enterprise-ai-2025-a-u-s-market-decision-framework-for-vps-of-ai-product/)

**Decision Framework:**
- **Build** if Build score exceeds Buy score by ≥20%
- **Buy** if Buy exceeds Build by ≥20%
- **Blend** if results are within ±20% band

│   ├─ YES → BUILD custom or HYBRID (vendor platform + custom last-mile)
│   └─ NO → HYBRID (vendor platform + custom prompts/orchestration)
└─ NO → Are document types standardized (invoices, receipts, forms)?
    ├─ YES → BUY vendor solution (Azure, ABBYY, Rossum)
    └─ NO → HYBRID or BUILD if volume justifies investment
