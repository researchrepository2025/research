## Custom Build vs. Buy Analysis

### Build vs. Buy Decision Framework

**Build Percentage:** Data not verified/available for exact percentage, but industry sources indicate a hybrid approach is most common [Netguru](https://www.netguru.com/blog/build-vs-buy-ai)

### Cost Considerations

**Custom AI Solutions:**
- Typical Range: $100,000 to $500,000+ for enterprise-grade implementations [Netguru](https://www.netguru.com/blog/build-vs-buy-ai)

- Computing Costs: Average projected to increase by 89% between 2023-2025 [Netguru](https://www.netguru.com/blog/build-vs-buy-ai)

**Off-the-Shelf Solutions:**
- Typical Range: $200-$400 monthly subscriptions for basic platforms [Netguru](https://www.netguru.com/blog/build-vs-buy-ai)
- Lower initial financial outlay compared to custom development
- Implementation: Often in a matter of weeks [BayTech Consulting](https://www.baytechconsulting.com/blog/revolutionizing-real-estate-ais-role-in-future-2025)

### Development Time

**External AI Consultants:**

**In-House Teams:**

### Strategic Considerations

- Address common, universal pain points
- Lower initial investment
- Effective at solving common problems [BayTech Consulting](https://www.baytechconsulting.com/blog/revolutionizing-real-estate-ais-role-in-future-2025)

**Off-the-Shelf Limitations:**
- Cannot create unique competitive advantage by definition
- If every brokerage uses the same AI-powered CRM, it becomes a baseline operational tool, not a differentiator [BayTech Consulting](https://www.baytechconsulting.com/blog/revolutionizing-real-estate-ais-role-in-future-2025)

**Custom Solution Advantages:**
- Higher upfront investment in time and capital
- Far greater long-term ROI

- Platforms empower non-technical users to build applications without writing code
- Sometimes called "vibe coding platforms"
- Simplify development, automate workflows, allow teams to rapidly prototype tools [Adventures in CRE](https://www.adventuresincre.com/ai-tools-commercial-real-estate/)

**Hybrid Approach (Most Common):**

- Simultaneously develop internal talent [Netguru](https://www.netguru.com/blog/build-vs-buy-ai)
- Companies should ensure the system fits well with existing technology and solves specific needs [Appinventiv](https://appinventiv.com/blog/ai-in-real-estate/)

### Implementation Best Practices

- Most successful real estate companies begin with one high-impact use case, prove ROI, and then expand AI adoption across multiple business units [Softkraft](https://www.softkraft.co/real-estate-ai/)
- Choose a sub-portfolio for a 3-6 month pilot

**GAO Report (September 2025):**

- Violations can result in ad rejections, account restrictions, or even permanent bans
- Housing ads must be declared under a Special Ad Category, limiting targeting options [AdAmigo](https://www.adamigo.ai/blog/meta-housing-ads-policy-real-estate-compliance-tips)

### Additional Regulatory Areas

**Appraisal Regulations:**
