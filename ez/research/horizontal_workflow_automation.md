### Integration Patterns

**Hybrid Approach (Increasingly Common):**
- Use commercial platforms for standard workflows (HR, IT service desk)
- Build custom agents for competitive differentiation (customer-facing, core business logic)
- Leverage low-code for departmental automation
- Total cost: $50,000-$300,000 depending on mix [(Lyzr.ai)](https://www.lyzr.ai/blog/enterprise-workflow-automation/)

**Key Integration Considerations:**

| Aspect | Requirement | Impact on Choice |
|--------|-------------|------------------|

| **Compliance** | GDPR, ISO, HIPAA adherence | Essential for regulated industries; may require self-hosted/build | [(Cflow)](https://www.cflowapps.com/enterprise-workflow-automation-software/) |
| **Scalability** | Support current and future growth | Choose solutions with flexible pricing and architecture | [(Cflow)](https://www.cflowapps.com/enterprise-workflow-automation-software/) |

**Strategic Recommendation:**
- "Design with change as the constant, using API-first approaches and microservices that can be swapped out when better options emerge" [(Meta Design Solutions)](https://metadesignsolutions.com/complete-guide-to-enterprise-workflow-automation-in-2025/)
- Start with pre-built solutions for proven use cases
- Build custom only where differentiation justifies investment
- Use frameworks (LangGraph, CrewAI) to reduce custom development costs by 40-60%
