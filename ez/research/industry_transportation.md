- Custom builds require longer timelines (months to years) but offer competitive differentiation [Stfalcon](https://stfalcon.com/en/blog/post/legacy-software-modernization)

**Percentage Breakdown:**
- Data not verified/available for exact enterprise custom build % in transportation/logistics sector specifically
- General enterprise trend: 88% of U.S. firms plan to increase AI spending in next 12 months [Second Talent](https://www.secondtalent.com/resources/ai-adoption-in-enterprise-statistics/)

### Key Build vs. Buy Considerations

| Factor | Build Custom | Buy Off-the-Shelf |
|--------|--------------|-------------------|
| **Timeline** | Months to years [Stfalcon](https://stfalcon.com/en/blog/post/legacy-software-modernization) | Weeks to months [Tech.co](https://tech.co/logistics/build-buy-ai-automation-logistics) |
| **Cost** | Higher upfront; $0.5M-$1M+ per application [Oliver Wyman](https://www.oliverwyman.com/our-expertise/insights/2025/nov/how-logistics-operators-harness-ai-to-boost-efficiency.html) | Lower initial; subscription-based |

---

## Regulatory Considerations

### 1. DOT Regulations for Autonomous Vehicles & AI

**Current Regulatory Status (2025):**
- **No ADS-specific federal standards exist:** Neither Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (FMVSSs) nor Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations (FMCSRs) include technical requirements for Automated Driving Systems (ADS) [FMCSA](https://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/newsroom/safe-integration-automated-driving-systems-equipped-commercial-motor-vehicles)
- **Voluntary self-certification required:** FMCSA expects manufacturers/ADS companies to provide motor carriers with self-certification of ADS capabilities based on voluntary safety assessments [FMCSA](https://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/newsroom/safe-integration-automated-driving-systems-equipped-commercial-motor-vehicles)

**April 2025 NHTSA Framework:**
On April 24, 2025, U.S. Transportation Secretary announced new NHTSA Automated Vehicle Framework with 3 principles [Mayer Brown](https://www.mayerbrown.com/en/insights/publications/2025/04/dot-and-nhtsa-announce-autonomous-vehicle-framework):
1. Prioritize safety of ongoing AV operations on public roads
2. Unleash innovation by removing unnecessary regulatory barriers
3. Enable commercial deployment of AVs to enhance safety and mobility

**Key Actions:**
- Third Amended Standing General Order 2021-01 issued [Mayer Brown](https://www.mayerbrown.com/en/insights/publications/2025/04/dot-and-nhtsa-announce-autonomous-vehicle-framework)
- Expansion of Automated Vehicle Exemption Program to include domestically produced vehicles [Mayer Brown](https://www.mayerbrown.com/en/insights/publications/2025/04/dot-and-nhtsa-announce-autonomous-vehicle-framework)

**Regulatory Challenges:**
- **Federal hurdles remain:** Title 49 CFR rules for large truck pullovers create barriers for autonomous trucks (e.g., Aurora's lawsuit over warning beacon requirements vs. traffic cone requirements) [BGR](https://www.bgr.com/2037571/autonomous-ai-driven-trucks-federal-rule-warning-signals/)
- **State-level fragmentation:** 25 states have adopted AV statutes with varying requirements for testing, deployment, and reporting [Morgan Lewis](https://www.morganlewis.com/pubs/2025/01/avia-publishes-federal-policy-framework-for-autonomous-vehicles)
- **Industry calls for federal framework:** AV Industry Association (AVIA) published "Securing American Leadership in Autonomous Vehicles" in Jan 2025 with policy recommendations for DOT and Congress [Morgan Lewis](https://www.morganlewis.com/pubs/2025/01/avia-publishes-federal-policy-framework-for-autonomous-vehicles)

**Proposed Safety Certification (AVIA Recommendations):**
- Promulgate Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) requiring manufacturers to self-certify to ADS behavioral competency tests (including detection/response to road users) [AV Policy](https://www.theavindustry.org/policy)
- Require manufacturers to develop "safety case" documenting hardware, software, sensor suite capabilities, and crash detection/response [AV Policy](https://www.theavindustry.org/policy)

### 2. Safety Certifications & Compliance

**FMCSA ELD Mandate:**
- Electronic Logging Device (ELD) mandate remains in effect; all major fleet management vendors (Geotab, Samsara, Verizon Connect, Omnitracs) provide FMCSA-certified ELD compliance [Fleet Logging](https://fleetlogging.com/fleet-management/omnitracs-vs-trimble-fleet-management/)

**Hours of Service (HOS) Regulations:**
- AI-powered fleet management systems include automated HOS tracking and violation alerts
- Driver fatigue detection: Samsara launched AI-powered drowsiness detection for inward cameras (Oct 2024) [FleetOwner](https://www.fleetowner.com/technology/article/55250552/trucking-ai-outlook-new-solutions-improving-transportation-technology-in-2025)

**State-Level AV Testing/Deployment Permits:**
- **California example:** DMV updated regulations for testing/deployment of autonomous vehicles (both light-duty and heavy-duty >10,001 lbs) with DMV-approved permit required [California DMV](https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/vehicle-industry-services/autonomous-vehicles/california-autonomous-vehicle-regulations/)

**CBP AI Use in Enforcement:**
- U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) uses AI for cargo screening, border security, and compliance checks [DHS](https://www.dhs.gov/ai/use-case-inventory/cbp)

### 3. International Trade Compliance

**AI-Powered Customs Solutions (2025 Developments):**
