## 4. Build vs. Buy Analysis

### When Enterprises Build Custom Sales Intelligence

**Primary Drivers for Custom Build:**

1. **Unique Data Requirements**
   - Industry-specific compliance (HIPAA, FINRA, GDPR) preventing cloud vendor data sharing
   - Proprietary sales methodologies requiring custom scoring models
   - Integration with legacy systems not supported by SaaS vendors

2. **Cost at Scale**
   - Very large sales organizations (1,000+ reps) where per-seat SaaS pricing exceeds build costs
   - High call volumes where per-minute transcription costs become prohibitive
   - Example: At 10,000 hours/month transcription, AssemblyAI costs = $1,500/month vs. self-hosted Whisper infrastructure

3. **Competitive Differentiation**
   - Sales intelligence capabilities as core product differentiator (e.g., Salesforce building Einstein vs. buying Gong)
   - Novel AI applications not available in commercial products
   - Real-time capabilities exceeding SaaS vendor latency requirements

4. **Data Sovereignty**
   - Regulatory requirements mandating on-premise deployment
   - Government/defense contractors with air-gapped environments
   - International companies with data localization laws

5. **Platform Strategy**
   - Building sales intelligence into larger enterprise platform (e.g., Microsoft embedding AI in Dynamics 365)
   - Desire to monetize sales intelligence capabilities for customers
   - Deep integration with proprietary data science platforms

**Companies Building Custom (2025 Examples):**
- **Salesforce:** Building Einstein Model Builder vs. buying third-party solutions [Source](https://www.salesforceben.com/get-started-with-salesforce-einstein-model-builder/)
- **Microsoft:** Copilot and agents built for Dynamics 365 (announced Microsoft Ignite 2025) [Source](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/2025/11/18/microsoft-ignite-2025-copilot-and-agents-built-to-power-the-frontier-firm/)

### Build vs. Buy Decision Framework

#### Choose BUY When:

1. **Time-to-Value Critical**
   - Need operational platform in 1-3 months vs. 12-18 months build time
   - Competitive pressure requiring immediate sales intelligence capabilities

2. **Standard Use Cases**
   - Sales team needs align with commercial platform capabilities
   - No unique regulatory or technical constraints

3. **Smaller Scale**
   - <500 sales reps where per-seat economics favor SaaS
   - <5,000 hours/month transcription volume

4. **Limited AI/ML Expertise**
   - Hiring AI team not feasible or strategic
   - Preference for vendor-managed ML model updates and improvements

5. **Focus on Core Business**
   - Sales intelligence is enabler, not differentiator
   - Engineering resources better allocated to product development

**Buy Advantages:**
- Faster deployment (weeks vs. months)
- Vendor-managed updates and improvements
- Proven ROI: 77% more revenue per rep using AI tools [Source](https://venturebeat.com/ai/gong-study-sales-teams-using-ai-generate-77-more-revenue-per-rep)
- Predictable costs (subscription model)
- Access to vendor best practices and benchmarks

---

#### Choose BUILD When:

1. **Massive Scale**
   - 1,000+ sales reps where per-seat costs exceed build economics
   - >20,000 hours/month transcription volume

2. **Unique Requirements**
   - Proprietary sales methodologies requiring custom ML models
   - Industry-specific compliance not supported by SaaS vendors
   - Data residency requirements (air-gapped, on-premise)

3. **Platform Strategy**
   - Sales intelligence as core product differentiator
   - Monetization plans for AI capabilities
   - Deep integration with proprietary systems

4. **Existing AI Capabilities**
   - In-house AI/ML team already built
   - Infrastructure and MLOps already in place
   - Desire for full control over models and data

5. **Long-Term Cost Optimization**
   - 3+ year horizon where build costs amortize favorably
   - Example: 1,000 reps × $200/user/month × 36 months = $7.2M SaaS vs. $2.5M-$5.5M build

**Build Advantages:**
- Full customization and control
- No vendor lock-in
- Potentially lower costs at very large scale (1,000+ users)
- Ability to monetize IP
- Data privacy and sovereignty

#### Hybrid/Platform Approach (Emerging Best Practice)

**The "AI Platform" Model:**
- **Concept:** Foundation services delivered out-of-the-box with customizable capabilities on top [Source](https://www.informationweek.com/machine-learning-ai/ai-buy-or-build-)
- **Advantages:**
  - Quicker and easier than in-house build
  - More custom capability than off-the-shelf AI
  - Reduces binary build vs. buy dilemma [Source](https://www.informationweek.com/machine-learning-ai/ai-buy-or-build-)

**Market Trend:**
- **Buyer Preference:** 50%+ prefer to buy resources/services rather than build in-house [Source](https://www.informationweek.com/machine-learning-ai/ai-buy-or-build-)
- **Challenge:** 47% find it "significantly challenging" to develop solutions tailored to their business [Source](https://www.informationweek.com/machine-learning-ai/ai-buy-or-build-)

**Example Hybrid Approaches:**
1. **Buy conversation intelligence platform + Build custom scoring models**
   - Leverage vendor's transcription and basic analysis
   - Train proprietary lead scoring on company data

2. **Buy speech-to-text API + Build analysis layer**
   - Use AssemblyAI/Deepgram for transcription
   - Build custom LLM analysis pipelines for unique use cases

3. **Buy CRM + Build embedded AI agents**
   - Use Salesforce LLM Open Connector [Source](https://developer.salesforce.com/blogs/2024/10/build-generative-ai-solutions-with-llm-open-connector)
   - Connect custom/open-source LLMs to Salesforce workflows

- **Demonstrated Success:** 90% reduction in prospecting costs, 65% increase in pipeline (Fortune 500 examples) [Source](https://sailes.com/blog/the-enterprise-ai-advantage-why-2025-will-be-the-year-of-unified-sales-intelligence)
- **Sales Productivity:** 30% increase with AI-driven CRM [Source](https://www.aalpha.net/blog/how-to-integrate-ai-agents-with-crm/)
- **Revenue Per Rep:** 77% increase for teams using AI regularly [Source](https://venturebeat.com/ai/gong-study-sales-teams-using-ai-generate-77-more-revenue-per-rep)

**Custom Build ROI Challenges:**
- **Low Success Rate:** 60% of enterprises expect under 50% ROI from ML/GenAI efforts [Source](https://sailes.com/blog/the-enterprise-ai-advantage-why-2025-will-be-the-year-of-unified-sales-intelligence)
- **Root Causes:** Poor data quality, unclear KPIs, solutions built without clear business fit [Source](https://sailes.com/blog/the-enterprise-ai-advantage-why-2025-will-be-the-year-of-unified-sales-intelligence)
- **Only ~50% of organizations seeing significant financial impact** [Source](https://sailes.com/blog/the-enterprise-ai-advantage-why-2025-will-be-the-year-of-unified-sales-intelligence)

**Decision Metrics:**
- **Break-even Analysis:** Compare 3-year SaaS costs vs. build costs including opportunity cost
- **Risk Assessment:** Factor in 500-1,000% project overrun potential for builds [Source](https://agentiveaiq.com/blog/how-much-does-an-ai-assistant-cost-in-2025)
- **Strategic Alignment:** Evaluate if sales intelligence is core competency or enabling technology
