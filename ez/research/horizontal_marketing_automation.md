#### Integration Patterns

1. **CDP-Centric Architecture** (Most Common for 2025):
   - CDP serves as central hub integrating all customer data sources
   - Marketing automation platform pulls unified customer profiles from CDP
   - LLM APIs called for content generation and personalization
   - Email/SMS APIs triggered by automation workflows
   - Analytics feeds back into CDP for continuous optimization
   - [Source: CMSWire](https://www.cmswire.com/customer-data-platforms/what-is-a-customer-data-platform-cdp/)

2. **API-First Microservices Architecture**:
   - Independent services for email, SMS, push, web personalization
   - Central orchestration layer coordinating across services
   - Event-driven triggers via webhooks and message queues
   - LLM layer as shared service across all channels
   - [Source: Labnify](https://labnify.com/blog/mailchimp-vs-sendgrid-api-performance-and-deliverability/)

3. **Hybrid Platform + Custom Architecture**:
   - Commercial platform (HubSpot, Marketo) for core automation
   - Custom components for unique business logic and differentiation
   - API integrations extending platform capabilities
   - Custom LLM implementations for proprietary models
   - [Source: Chiefmartec Landscape](https://chiefmartec.com/2025/05/2025-marketing-technology-landscape-supergraphic-100x-growth-since-2011-but-now-with-ai/)

#### No-Code/Low-Code Considerations

- Rise of no-code interfaces enabling marketers to build complex automation without technical expertise
- AI having massive multiplier effect on low-code/no-code capabilities, giving rise to "citizen developers"
- 10% of B2B companies now use custom-built martech platforms as their center (5x increase from 2%, reversing decade-long shift from custom to commercial)
