## Custom Build Patterns

### Build vs. Buy Analysis

**Cost Considerations:**
- Custom AI solutions: $100,000 - $500,000+ for enterprise-grade implementations [Netguru](https://www.netguru.com/blog/build-vs-buy-ai)
- Off-the-shelf platforms: $200-$400/month starting subscriptions [Netguru](https://www.netguru.com/blog/build-vs-buy-ai)
- Annual maintenance: $8,999 - $14,999 for custom solutions (10-20% of budget) [Netguru](https://www.netguru.com/blog/build-vs-buy-ai)
- Monthly maintenance for enterprise AI: $5,000 - $20,000 [Netguru](https://www.netguru.com/blog/build-vs-buy-ai)
- Computing costs projected to increase 89% between 2023-2025 [Netguru](https://www.netguru.com/blog/build-vs-buy-ai)
- Goldman Sachs estimates: $390 billion AI capex in 2025, 19% increase in 2026 [CZM AI](https://czm.ai/ai-insights/build-vs-buy-ai-capex-competitive-edge)

**Adoption Patterns:**
- Gartner predicts 30% of AI projects will be abandoned in 2025 due to low data quality, inadequate risk controls, and rising costs [Netguru](https://www.netguru.com/blog/build-vs-buy-ai)
- Recent industry estimates: 80%+ of enterprise AI initiatives fail [Netguru](https://www.netguru.com/blog/build-vs-buy-ai)

- Switching between AI technologies from different vendors: typically 2x the initial investment cost [Netguru](https://www.netguru.com/blog/build-vs-buy-ai)

**Percentage Build vs. Buy:** Data not verified/available - specific percentages for utilities sector not found in 2025 sources

**Recommended Approach:**
- Hybrid model most common: Buy for speed and proven integration, build for tailored capabilities and cross-system reach [Retool](https://retool.com/blog/build-vs-buy-ai-agents)
- Many companies start with purchased solutions, then build custom tools to handle gaps [Modern Marketing Partners](https://www.modernmarketingpartners.com/2025/09/15/build-vs-buy-the-ultimate-guide-to-deciding-on-ai-tools-for-your-business/)
- MIT Sloan identifies three approaches: Buy (quick adoption), Boost (enhance with proprietary data), Build (maximum control) [MIT Sloan](https://mitsloan.mit.edu/ideas-made-to-matter/buy-boost-or-build-choose-your-path-to-generative-ai)

**Common Building Blocks for Custom Solutions:**
- **Foundation Models:** Microsoft Azure Foundry Models (1,900+ models including OpenAI GPT-5, GPT-4.1, o4-mini, o3, Anthropic Claude, Meta Llama, Mistral, Cohere) [Microsoft](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-foundry/models)
- **Cloud Infrastructure:** Microsoft Azure (utilities often use Azure OpenAI integration), Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, AWS
- **Deployment Options:** Serverless API (MaaS), hosted fine-tuning [Microsoft](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/openai/overview)
- **Customization Methods:** RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) for grounding in proprietary data, fine-tuning for specific topics [Microsoft](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/openai/concepts/customizing-llms?view=foundry-classic)

**Utility-Specific Cases:**
- Vodafone Spain, CityFibre, Virgin Media O2 use Deepomatic Lens for field operations: saved $755,400 in annual audit costs, 423% ROI [IQGeo](https://www.iqgeo.com/blog/build-vs.-buy-computer-vision-ai-for-telecom-and-utilities-field-operations)
