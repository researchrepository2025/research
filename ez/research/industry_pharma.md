## Regulatory Considerations

### FDA AI/ML Guidance (2025)

**Key Guidance Document:**
- **"Considerations for the Use of Artificial Intelligence to Support Regulatory Decision-Making for Drug and Biological Products"** (Draft, January 2025) [FDA](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-proposes-framework-advance-credibility-ai-models-used-drug-and-biological-product-submissions)
- **First FDA guidance** on AI for drug/biological product development [Goodwin](https://www.goodwinlaw.com/en/insights/publications/2025/01/alerts-lifesciences-aiml-fda-publishes-its-first-draft-guidance)

**Risk-Based Credibility Assessment Framework:**
1. Define the question of interest
2. Define the context of use (COU) for the AI model
3. Assess the AI model risk
4. Develop a plan to establish credibility
5. Execute the plan
6. Document results and deviations
7. Continuous monitoring [FDA](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/01/07/2024-31542/considerations-for-the-use-of-artificial-intelligence-to-support-regulatory-decision-making-for-drug)

**Scope:**
- Applies to nonclinical, clinical, postmarketing, and manufacturing phases
- **Does NOT cover**: Drug discovery, operational efficiencies that don't impact patient safety/drug quality [Goodwin](https://www.goodwinlaw.com/en/insights/publications/2025/01/alerts-lifesciences-aiml-fda-publishes-its-first-draft-guidance)

**Development Background:**
- Informed by Duke Margolis Institute workshop (Dec 2022)
- 800+ comments on May 2023 discussion paper
- CDER's experience with 500+ AI submissions (2016-2023)
- Public workshop (Aug 6, 2024) [Federal Register](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/01/07/2024-31542/considerations-for-the-use-of-artificial-intelligence-to-support-regulatory-decision-making-for-drug)

**FDA Agentic AI Initiative:**
- FDA deployed agentic AI capabilities for all agency employees (announced 2025)
- Two-month Agentic AI Challenge for staff to build solutions
- FDA Scientific Computing Day demo (Jan 2026) [BioSpace](https://www.biospace.com/policy/as-fda-deploys-agentic-ai-pharma-begins-testing-the-next-frontier-of-intelligent-automation)

**Key Requirements:**
- Models must be **validated against predefined metrics**
- **Continuous oversight** required to detect performance drift
- **Formal change control** for AI model updates (versioning, impact assessment)
- **Qualified human review** for AI-made decisions, especially critical process steps [Rephine](https://www.rephine.com/resources/blog/emas-annex-22-ai-in-pharma-gets-a-gxp-rulebook/)

### GxP Compliance & Validation

**Key Standards:**

**AI Validation Challenges:**
- AI/ML models **evolve**, requiring continuous monitoring and robust change control [PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12195787/)
- Must define **model lifecycle strategy**: performance monitoring, retraining schedules, version control, revalidation triggers [PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12195787/)
- **Explainable AI (XAI)** needed to address "black-box" nature for regulatory compliance [CMHRJ](https://cmhrj.com/index.php/cmhrj/article/view/509)

**Documentation Requirements:**
- Sponsors must demonstrate AI model **"credibility"** and validation (like other software) [FDLI](https://www.fdli.org/2025/07/regulating-the-use-of-ai-in-drug-development-legal-challenges-and-compliance-strategies/)
- **Human oversight** remains critical: companies retain responsibility for patient safety decisions [Intuition Labs](https://intuitionlabs.ai/articles/ai-biopharma-regulation-2025)

### Clinical Trial Regulations

**AI in Clinical Trials:**
- AI used in regulatory submissions must be **treated like other software**: credibility and validation required [FDLI](https://www.fdli.org/2025/07/regulating-the-use-of-ai-in-drug-development-legal-challenges-and-compliance-strategies/)
- Unlearn's digital twins: **EMA qualification** for Phase 2/3 primary analysis [Drug Discovery Trends](https://www.drugdiscoverytrends.com/unlearn-ceo-digital-twins-could-slash-clinical-trial-patient-enrollment-by-25-or-more/)

### Pharmacovigilance Regulations

**Current State (2025):**
- **No PV-specific AI regulations** yet; general GVP provisions apply [Intuition Labs](https://intuitionlabs.ai/articles/ai-pharmacovigilance-drug-safety)
- **Marketing authorization holder retains responsibility** for patient safety; AI is an aid, not replacement [Intuition Labs](https://intuitionlabs.ai/articles/ai-pharmacovigilance-drug-safety)
- **FDA Emerging Drug Safety Technology Program (EDSTP)**: Launched 2024, continues supporting AI adoption in PV [IQVIA](https://www.iqvia.com/blogs/2025/09/how-ai-is-reshaping-pharmacovigilance)
