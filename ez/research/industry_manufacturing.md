**Off-the-Shelf Costs:**
- **Initial Subscription:** $200-$400/month typical starting point [Appinventiv](https://appinventiv.com/blog/custom-ai-vs-off-the-shelf-ai/)
- **Reality Check:** Hidden costs often multiply initial estimates

### Build vs Buy Decision Framework

**When to BUILD:**
- Capability underpins competitive advantage [MarkTechPost](https://www.marktechpost.com/2025/08/24/build-vs-buy-for-enterprise-ai-2025-a-u-s-market-decision-framework-for-vps-of-ai-product/)

- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- Data Loss Prevention (DLP)
- Compliance attestations

Then build the last mile:
