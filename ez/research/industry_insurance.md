## 3. Custom Build Patterns

### Build vs. Buy Landscape

**Enterprise Approach:**
- 71.50% of AI in insurance market share held by large insurers in 2024 [[Mordor Intelligence](https://www.mordorintelligence.com/industry-reports/ai-in-insurance-market)]
- Small and medium insurers expanding at 40.60% CAGR (2025-2030), indicating catch-up growth [[Mordor Intelligence](https://www.mordorintelligence.com/industry-reports/ai-in-insurance-market)]
- Most advanced insurance companies invest $25-100 million annually in AI [[McKinsey](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/financial-services/our-insights/the-future-of-ai-in-the-insurance-industry)]

**Build vs. Buy Decision Framework:**
- Only 7% of insurers successfully scale AI projects from pilots [[BCG](https://www.bcg.com/publications/2025/insurance-leads-ai-adoption-now-time-to-scale)]
- Teams often favor custom-built solutions over scalable low-code tools, missing opportunities for tech reusability [[BCG](https://www.bcg.com/publications/2025/insurance-leads-ai-adoption-now-time-to-scale)]

### Cost Considerations

**Custom Build:**
- $100,000 to $500,000+ for enterprise-grade implementations [[Netguru](https://www.netguru.com/blog/build-vs-buy-ai)]
- Maintenance: 10-20% of AI budget annually, $8,999-$14,999 yearly for custom solutions [[Netguru](https://www.netguru.com/blog/build-vs-buy-ai)]
- Enterprise AI systems: $5,000-$20,000 monthly maintenance [[Netguru](https://www.netguru.com/blog/build-vs-buy-ai)]
- Compliance requirements: $10,000-$100,000 annually [[Netguru](https://www.netguru.com/blog/build-vs-buy-ai)]

**Buy/SaaS:**
- Off-the-shelf AI platforms: $200-$400/month starting subscriptions [[Netguru](https://www.netguru.com/blog/build-vs-buy-ai)]
- Enterprise pricing typically customized (not publicly disclosed)

### Common Building Blocks

**When Insurers Build:**
- Simple prediction models with internal data science teams for customized, agile solutions [[Insurance News Net](https://insurancenewsnet.com/innarticle/building-vs-buying-an-ai-solution-what-should-insurtechs-consider)]
- Core functions (underwriting, claims management) where custom-built AI serves as differentiator using proprietary data [[BCG](https://www.bcg.com/publications/2025/how-insurers-can-supercharge-strategy-with-artificial-intelligence)]
- Co-pilots and simple models for specific internal needs

**When Insurers Buy:**
- Standardized solutions for corporate functions (finance, HR, procurement) [[BCG](https://www.bcg.com/publications/2025/how-insurers-can-supercharge-strategy-with-artificial-intelligence)]
- Urgent, complex, and deep areas where speed to market is critical [[Insurance News Net](https://insurancenewsnet.com/innarticle/building-vs-buying-an-ai-solution-what-should-insurtechs-consider)]
- Proven technologies for rapid deployment

### Hybrid Approach (Most Common in 2025)

**"Buy and Customize" Strategy:**
- Insurers increasingly combine both approaches [[Igloo](https://iglooinsure.com/buy-vs-build-insurance-tech-solutions/)]
- Outsource standardized gen AI solutions, concentrate internal resources on core differentiators [[BCG](https://www.bcg.com/publications/2025/how-insurers-can-supercharge-strategy-with-artificial-intelligence)]
- Requires internal orchestration capability to integrate internal and external solutions [[BCG](https://www.bcg.com/publications/2025/how-insurers-can-supercharge-strategy-with-artificial-intelligence)]

**Technology Stack Components:**
- Large Language Models: OpenAI, Anthropic Claude, Google Gemini (accessed via API)
- Vector Databases: Pinecone, Weaviate, ChromaDB for RAG implementations
- MLOps Platforms: Amazon SageMaker, Azure ML, Google Vertex AI

- Less expensive upfront vs. custom development [[Insurance News Net](https://insurancenewsnet.com/innarticle/building-vs-buying-an-ai-solution-what-should-insurtechs-consider)]
- Rapid IT efficiency gains without building custom models from scratch [[BCG](https://www.bcg.com/publications/2025/how-insurers-can-supercharge-strategy-with-artificial-intelligence)]

**Challenges:**
- Large amounts of tech debt limiting scalability [[BCG](https://www.bcg.com/publications/2025/insurance-leads-ai-adoption-now-time-to-scale)]
- Skills and resources (52%), data challenges (40%), fear of unmet promises (38%) as top barriers [[Wolters Kluwer](https://www.wolterskluwer.com/en/expert-insights/2025-insurance-tech-trends-ai-big-data-and-cautious-adoption)]
