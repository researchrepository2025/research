## Regulatory Considerations

### 1. FERPA (Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act) Compliance

**Overview:**
- Federal law established in 1974 protecting privacy of student education records ([Concentric AI](https://concentric.ai/maintain-ferpa-compliance-with-concentric-ai/))
- Sets standard for protecting sensitive student data
- Rights transfer to students at age 18 or when attending postsecondary education ([Flywire](https://www.flywire.com/resources/cto-pov-how-higher-education-institutions-can-balance-ai-tech-and-ferpa-compliance))

**2025 Compliance Deadlines:**
- By April 30, 2025, SEAs and LEAs required to submit documentation demonstrating FERPA compliance ([Concentric AI](https://concentric.ai/maintain-ferpa-compliance-with-concentric-ai/))

**Key Challenges with AI:**
- FERPA lacks clear cybersecurity requirements despite schools relying on hundreds of ed-tech tools ([Concentric AI](https://concentric.ai/maintain-ferpa-compliance-with-concentric-ai/))
- Experts urge lawmakers to modernize FERPA with vendor security obligations ([Concentric AI](https://concentric.ai/maintain-ferpa-compliance-with-concentric-ai/))
- Institutions should prepare for potential cybersecurity-specific mandates ([Concentric AI](https://concentric.ai/maintain-ferpa-compliance-with-concentric-ai/))

**Best Practices for AI Use:**
- Obtain explicit consent from students before using education records with AI tools (unless directory information) ([NMU CTL](https://nmu.edu/ctl/understanding-ferpa-context-generative-ai-guide-faculty))
- Use only minimum data necessary for AI application to function ([NMU CTL](https://nmu.edu/ctl/understanding-ferpa-context-generative-ai-guide-faculty))
- Ensure third-party AI service providers comply with FERPA and have appropriate data protection measures ([NMU CTL](https://nmu.edu/ctl/understanding-ferpa-context-generative-ai-guide-faculty))

**AI for FERPA Compliance:**
- Automated data classification and access controls
- AI analyzes large volumes of data to identify FERPA-protected information ([Concentric AI](https://concentric.ai/maintain-ferpa-compliance-with-concentric-ai/))
- Continuous monitoring of who accesses student data, when, and why ([Concentric AI](https://concentric.ai/maintain-ferpa-compliance-with-concentric-ai/))

**Third-Party Vendor Requirements:**
- Vendors must have explicit FERPA compliance clauses in contracts ([Element451](https://element451.com/blog/ai-student-data-and-ferpa-compliance))
- Vendors act as "School Official" and are bound by FERPA ([Element451](https://element451.com/blog/ai-student-data-and-ferpa-compliance))
- Vendors must not use student records outside contract scope ([Element451](https://element451.com/blog/ai-student-data-and-ferpa-compliance))
- SOC 2 Type II certification is strong indicator of security compliance ([Element451](https://element451.com/blog/ai-student-data-and-ferpa-compliance))

**Additional Privacy Regulations:**
- **COPPA (Children's Online Privacy Protection Act):** Requires parental consent for data collection from students under 13 ([FPF](https://fpf.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Ed_AI_legal_compliance.pdf_FInal_OCT24.pdf))
- **State Privacy Laws:** 128+ state privacy laws across U.S. with varying requirements ([Concentric AI](https://concentric.ai/maintain-ferpa-compliance-with-concentric-ai/))

**De-identification Challenges:**
- FERPA's high standard for de-identification can limit data used in AI systems ([NMU CTL](https://nmu.edu/ctl/understanding-ferpa-context-generative-ai-guide-faculty))
- Risk of re-identification grows as more information is included ([NMU CTL](https://nmu.edu/ctl/understanding-ferpa-context-generative-ai-guide-faculty))
- AI systems may reveal sensitive student information ([NMU CTL](https://nmu.edu/ctl/understanding-ferpa-context-generative-ai-guide-faculty))

### 2. Academic Integrity Concerns

**Current State (2025):**
- "Academic integrity is at a crossroads in 2025" ([Packback](https://packback.co/resources/blog/moving-beyond-plagiarism-and-ai-detection-academic-integrity-in-2025/))
- Emergence of AI exposed cracks in old approaches of plagiarism policing and after-the-fact penalties ([Packback](https://packback.co/resources/blog/moving-beyond-plagiarism-and-ai-detection-academic-integrity-in-2025/))

**Key Statistics:**
- 18% of UK undergraduate students admit to submitting AI-generated text in assignments ([Packback](https://packback.co/resources/blog/moving-beyond-plagiarism-and-ai-detection-academic-integrity-in-2025/))
- 95% of academic community believes AI is being misused at their institutions ([Packback](https://packback.co/resources/blog/moving-beyond-plagiarism-and-ai-detection-academic-integrity-in-2025/))
- 63% of teachers reported students for using AI on schoolwork in 2023-24, up from 48% year before ([AllAboutAI](https://www.allaboutai.com/resources/ai-statistics/ai-cheating-in-schools/))
- Nearly 400% increase in AI-related misconduct incidents over three academic years ([AllAboutAI](https://www.allaboutai.com/resources/ai-statistics/ai-cheating-in-schools/))
- 51% of students would continue to use generative AI tools even if prohibited ([NMU CTL](https://nmu.edu/ctl/academic-dishonesty-using-generative-ai))

**AI Detection Effectiveness:**
- Faculty rate AI-specific plagiarism policies as only 28% effective ([Packback](https://packback.co/resources/blog/moving-beyond-plagiarism-and-ai-detection-academic-integrity-in-2025/))
- Traditional plagiarism policies: 49% effectiveness ([Packback](https://packback.co/resources/blog/moving-beyond-plagiarism-and-ai-detection-academic-integrity-in-2025/))
- Educational institutions implementing detection: 68% use detector tools, 45% redesign assessments, 58% update policies ([AllAboutAI](https://www.allaboutai.com/resources/ai-statistics/ai-cheating-in-schools/))

**Detection Tool Bias Concerns:**
- 61.22% of non-native English essays falsely flagged as AI-written ([AllAboutAI](https://www.allaboutai.com/resources/ai-statistics/ai-cheating-in-schools/))
- Some universities (Vanderbilt) disabled Turnitin's AI detection due to equity/accuracy concerns ([AllAboutAI](https://www.allaboutai.com/resources/ai-statistics/ai-cheating-in-schools/))
- AI detection may disproportionately flag students it's meant to protect ([AllAboutAI](https://www.allaboutai.com/resources/ai-statistics/ai-cheating-in-schools/))
- Raising serious questions about bias, due process, and educational equity ([AllAboutAI](https://www.allaboutai.com/resources/ai-statistics/ai-cheating-in-schools/))

**Shift in Approach:**
- Moving beyond detection doesn't mean stop caring about honesty - means treating honesty as product of engaging, well-supported learning process ([Packback](https://packback.co/resources/blog/moving-beyond-plagiarism-and-ai-detection-academic-integrity-in-2025/))
- Focus on detection feels inherently adversarial, sets up "us vs. them" dynamic ([Packback](https://packback.co/resources/blog/moving-beyond-plagiarism-and-ai-detection-academic-integrity-in-2025/))
- Research shows markers generally cannot distinguish assessments with GenAI input from those without ([British Journal of Educational Technology](https://bera-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/bjet.13585))

**Recommended Best Practices:**
- Hybrid approach: Combine AI detection with human judgment ([Cornell](https://teaching.cornell.edu/generative-artificial-intelligence/ai-academic-integrity))
- AI flags suspicious cases, but final decisions involve human review ([Cornell](https://teaching.cornell.edu/generative-artificial-intelligence/ai-academic-integrity))
- Clearly communicate policies in syllabi, assignment instructions, and verbally in class ([Cornell](https://teaching.cornell.edu/generative-artificial-intelligence/ai-academic-integrity))
- 59% of students worry over-reliance on AI could reduce critical thinking skills ([Packback](https://packback.co/resources/blog/moving-beyond-plagiarism-and-ai-detection-academic-integrity-in-2025/))

- Students with disabilities—who stand to gain most from AI tools—are often most disadvantaged or least able to use them ([EDUCAUSE](https://er.educause.edu/articles/2024/9/the-impact-of-ai-in-advancing-accessibility-for-learners-with-disabilities))
- 2023 survey: Fewer than 7% of respondents with disabilities believe there's adequate representation of their community in AI product development ([EDUCAUSE](https://er.educause.edu/articles/2024/9/the-impact-of-ai-in-advancing-accessibility-for-learners-with-disabilities))
- 87% of people with disabilities would be willing to provide end-user feedback to developers ([EDUCAUSE](https://er.educause.edu/articles/2024/9/the-impact-of-ai-in-advancing-accessibility-for-learners-with-disabilities))
- Many digital platforms still contain barriers excluding students with disabilities ([Cornell](https://teaching.cornell.edu/generative-artificial-intelligence/ai-accessibility))

**Emerging Standards:**
- **AAG v0.1 (Accessibility Guidelines for AI):** New draft framework inspired by WCAG, grounded in testability and inclusiveness ([Medium - Ankit Dhyani](https://medium.com/@anky18milestone/aag-v0-1-accessibility-guidelines-for-ai-interfaces-inspired-by-wcag-40ab4e8badc2))
- No standardized framework for making AI systems accessible to all users yet ([Medium - Ankit Dhyani](https://medium.com/@anky18milestone/aag-v0-1-accessibility-guidelines-for-ai-interfaces-inspired-by-wcag-40ab4e8badc2))

**Best Practices for Educators:**
- Apply Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) and Universal Design for Learning (UDL) when evaluating AI tools ([Cornell](https://teaching.cornell.edu/generative-artificial-intelligence/ai-accessibility))
- When learners required to use AI for assignment, AI tool itself should be keyboard navigable and accessible to assistive technologies like screen readers ([Cornell](https://teaching.cornell.edu/generative-artificial-intelligence/ai-accessibility))
- AI tools can support learning but only if accessible to all students ([Cornell](https://teaching.cornell.edu/generative-artificial-intelligence/ai-accessibility))
