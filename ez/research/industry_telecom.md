## 4. REGULATORY CONSIDERATIONS

### FCC Regulations (United States)

#### AI-Generated Robocalls and Robotexts
**Key Regulation:** FCC proposed new rules for AI-generated marketing calls and texts in 2025, building on January 2024 decision declaring AI-generated content qualifies as "artificial voice" under TCPA (Telephone Consumer Protection Act) [Cooley LLP](https://www.cooley.com/news/insight/2024/2024-09-03-fcc-proposes-new-regulations-for-ai-generated-robocalls).

**Definition:** "AI-generated call" defined as "a call that uses any technology or tool to generate an artificial or prerecorded voice or text using computational technology or other machine learning, including predictive algorithms, and large language models, to process natural language and produce voice or text content to communicate with a called party over an outbound telephone call" [Manatt](https://www.manatt.com/insights/newsletters/tcpa-connect/fcc-proposes-ai-regulations).

**Requirements:**
- "Clear and conspicuous" disclosure required for AI-generated calls or content [FCC Proposal](https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-proposes-first-ai-generated-robocall-robotext-rules-0)
- Consumer consent must be acquired before transmission [FCC Proposal](https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-proposes-first-ai-generated-robocall-robotext-rules-0)

**Exemptions:**
- People with hearing and speech disabilities exempt from consent or identification requirements when using AI-generated voice, as long as call doesn't contain unsolicited advertisement [Goodwin Law](https://www.goodwinlaw.com/en/insights/blogs/2024/07/fcc-proposes-new-rules-regarding-ai-generated-robocalls-and-robotexts)

#### FCC AI Action Plan (October 2025)
**Trump Administration AI Action Plan:** Recommended FCC "evaluate whether state AI regulations interfere with the [FCC's] ability to carry out its obligations and authorities under the Communications Act of 1934" [HWG LLP](https://hwglaw.com/2025/10/01/fcc-kicks-off-ai-action-plan/).

**Notice of Inquiry:** FCC seeking comment on "how the Commission has authority under sections 253 and 332(c)(7) to preempt these state and local AI regulations" and whether "state or local laws seeking to govern or limit uses of AI are prohibiting or effectively prohibiting the provision of wireline telecommunications services" [HWG LLP](https://hwglaw.com/2025/10/01/fcc-kicks-off-ai-action-plan/).

**Purpose:** Introduce significant opportunities and challenges related to regulatory changes and infrastructure development for telecommunications industry [Telco Magazine](https://telcomagazine.com/news/us-ai-action-plan-key-telecom-industry-impact-in-2025).

#### Recent Regulatory Changes
**Cybersecurity Requirements:** FCC abandoned effort to require telecommunications companies to meet minimum cybersecurity standards (2025) [Cybersecurity Dive](https://www.cybersecuritydive.com/news/fcc-eliminates-telecom-cybersecurity-requirements/806052/).

**Court Decision:** On January 24, 2025, Eleventh Circuit vacated an FCC rule in Insurance Marketing Coalition Limited v. Federal Communications Commission [NCLC Digital Library](https://library.nclc.org/article/top-six-tcparobocall-developments-20242025).

### Network Security Requirements

**AI-Driven Security Challenges:**

**Risk-Based Framework:**
- According to Omdia, telcos must contend with formal AI regulation from at least two jurisdictions: EU and South Korea [Telco Magazine](https://telcomagazine.com/news/telcos-face-complex-2025-rules-on-ai-security-ids)
- Both have adopted risk-based framework where most stringent rules are reserved for highest-risk AI applications [Telco Magazine](https://telcomagazine.com/news/telcos-face-complex-2025-rules-on-ai-security-ids)

#### United States (State-Level)

**State Privacy Laws:**

- Now must demonstrate transparency, explainability, and accountability [TelcoForge Guest Post](https://telcoforge.com/guest-post/guest-post-regulating-telecoms-in-the-ai-era-data-rights-privacy-and-fair-access/)

**Global Coordination Challenges:**
- Different regulations across jurisdictions (EU, U.S. states, South Korea, Brazil, etc.) create complex compliance landscape
- No unified global AI regulation framework for telecommunications as of 2025
