## Custom Build vs. Buy Patterns

### Build vs. Buy Statistics

**Off-the-Shelf Preference:**
- Off-the-shelf AI is winning over custom builds [Source](https://www.open-contracting.org/2025/11/10/the-surprising-shifts-in-how-the-public-sector-is-buying-ai-and-what-policymakers-can-do-about-it/)
- Organizations not rushing to buy complex, custom-built AI systems [Source](https://www.open-contracting.org/2025/11/10/the-surprising-shifts-in-how-the-public-sector-is-buying-ai-and-what-policymakers-can-do-about-it/)

**Custom Development Costs:**
- $100,000 to $500,000 for enterprise-grade custom solutions [Source](https://www.netguru.com/blog/build-vs-buy-ai)
- 65% of total costs materialize after deployment [Source](https://www.netguru.com/blog/build-vs-buy-ai)

**Off-the-Shelf Costs:**
- Monthly subscription: $200-$400 [Source](https://www.netguru.com/blog/build-vs-buy-ai)

**Blended Approach:**
- Most firms adopt a blend: buying vendor platforms with custom in-house layers [Source](https://completeaitraining.com/news/build-vs-buy-for-enterprise-ai-in-2025-a-practical-decision/)
- Build when AI drives competitive advantage, involves sensitive data, or requires deep integration [Source](https://completeaitraining.com/news/build-vs-buy-for-enterprise-ai-in-2025-a-practical-decision/)
- Buy when use case is commoditized, speed is critical, or vendors provide compliance capabilities [Source](https://completeaitraining.com/news/build-vs-buy-for-enterprise-ai-in-2025-a-practical-decision/)
