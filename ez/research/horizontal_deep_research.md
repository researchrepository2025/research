## 1. USE CASE DEFINITION

### Core Problem Being Solved

Deep Research AI agents solve the problem of time-intensive knowledge work that requires gathering, analyzing, and synthesizing information from hundreds of sources. These AI systems autonomously perform multi-step research tasks that would typically take human experts many hours or days to complete, delivering comprehensive reports with citations in minutes.

**Key Capabilities:**
- Autonomous multi-step research planning and execution
- Information aggregation from structured and unstructured sources
- Cross-referencing and fact-checking across multiple sources
- Synthesis and report generation with full citations
- Iterative refinement based on discovered information

### 4.5 Decision Framework

| Factor | Buy Off-the-Shelf | Build Custom |
|--------|-------------------|--------------|
| **Budget** | <$50K/year | >$150K initial + $30K+/year ongoing |
| **Timeline** | 1-4 weeks | 3-12 months |
| **Use Case** | Standard research, market analysis | Proprietary workflows, unique requirements |
| **Query Volume** | <50K/month | >100K/month (cost optimization) |
| **Data Sensitivity** | Low-medium | High (compliance, on-premise required) |
| **AI Expertise** | Limited/none | In-house AI/ML team available |
| **Customization Needs** | Low-medium | High (core competitive advantage) |
| **Risk Tolerance** | Low (prefer vendor support) | High (can manage technical risk) |
| **Integration Complexity** | Simple (standard APIs) | Complex (legacy systems, custom data) |

**Recommendation:**
- **Start with Buy:** 80% of enterprises should start with off-the-shelf solutions for faster time-to-value and lower risk
- **Transition to Build:** Consider custom build after 12-18 months if:
  - Query volume exceeds 100K/month (cost savings)
  - Unique requirements emerge that off-the-shelf cannot address
  - Research capabilities become core competitive differentiator
  - Internal AI expertise developed

**Hybrid Approach:**
- Use off-the-shelf for general research
- Build custom agents for proprietary workflows
- Leverage frameworks (LangChain, CrewAI) to accelerate custom development
- Maintain optionality to switch as needs evolve
