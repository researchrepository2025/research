## Custom Build vs. Buy Patterns

### Build vs. Buy Statistics
- **65% of total software costs occur after original deployment** (maintenance, updates) [Netguru](https://www.netguru.com/blog/build-vs-buy-ai)
- **Companies increase AI spending by 29% annually through 2028** [Netguru](https://www.netguru.com/blog/build-vs-buy-ai)
- **Maintenance consumes 10-20% of AI budget** annually ($8,999-$14,999 for custom solutions) [Netguru](https://www.netguru.com/blog/build-vs-buy-ai)
- **Average computing cost projected to increase 89% between 2023-2025** [Netguru](https://www.netguru.com/blog/build-vs-buy-ai)
- **Enterprise AI systems require $5,000-$20,000/month in maintenance** [Netguru](https://www.netguru.com/blog/build-vs-buy-ai)

### Dominant Strategy: Hybrid "Boost" Approach
**Most common approach:** Buy vendor solution, then enhance with proprietary data [MIT Sloan](https://mitsloan.mit.edu/ideas-made-to-matter/buy-boost-or-build-choose-your-path-to-generative-ai)

**Three Strategic Options:**
1. **Buy:** Quick adoption, limited differentiation, vendor dependence [MIT Sloan](https://mitsloan.mit.edu/ideas-made-to-matter/buy-boost-or-build-choose-your-path-to-generative-ai)
2. **Boost (Hybrid):** Purchase vendor solution + enhance with specific/proprietary data; increases accuracy but raises usage costs [MIT Sloan](https://mitsloan.mit.edu/ideas-made-to-matter/buy-boost-or-build-choose-your-path-to-generative-ai)
3. **Build:** Custom development; complete control, competitive differentiation; expensive and difficult; most companies fine-tune open-source foundational models instead [MIT Sloan](https://mitsloan.mit.edu/ideas-made-to-matter/buy-boost-or-build-choose-your-path-to-generative-ai)

### When Enterprises Build Custom:
- **No existing tool meets requirements**
- **Specialized needs, unique processes**
- **Large-scale operations**
- **Long-term goals requiring competitive differentiation** [Valere Labs](https://valerelabs.medium.com/custom-ai-vs-third-party-ai-solutions-which-is-better-for-your-business-in-2025-09e10a5e10f9)

### Common Building Blocks for Custom Solutions:
- **Open-source foundation models:** Fine-tuning LLaMA, Mistral, Stable Diffusion
- **Cloud ML platforms:** AWS SageMaker, Google Vertex AI, Azure ML
- **Pre-trained models via API:** OpenAI API, Anthropic API, Cohere, HuggingFace
- **Data annotation platforms** for custom training data

### Key Challenge: Talent Shortage
- **Hiring/retaining AI talent is top challenge**, especially outside core tech hubs
- **Required skill sets:** Data science, annotation pipelines, MLOps, deep learning engineering
- **Trend:** Many organizations shift to outsourced solutions or ready-to-integrate APIs [API4AI](https://medium.com/@API4AI/build-or-buy-how-to-make-the-right-choice-d96f501095ce)

## Regulatory Considerations

### Copyright & IP Concerns

**Major Lawsuits (2025):**
- **June 11, 2025:** Disney + Universal filed first major Hollywood lawsuit against **Midjourney** for direct/secondary copyright infringement of AI-generated images of copyrighted characters [Akin Gump](https://www.akingump.com/en/insights/alerts/beyond-the-strikes-how-ai-is-reshaping-the-media-and-entertainment-landscapeand-how-global-regulators-are-responding)
