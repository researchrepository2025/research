## 1. USE CASE DEFINITION

### Core Problem Being Solved

Knowledge management and enterprise search solutions address the critical challenge of information accessibility within organizations. [Customer experience agents spend nearly 40% of their day just searching for information, toggling between Slack, knowledge bases, past tickets, and product docs](https://www.ask-ai.com/blog/what-is-enterprise-rag-a-cx-leaders-guide-to-retrieval-augmented-generation-2025), creating a direct drain on budget, team morale, and customer satisfaction scores.

[RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) addresses core enterprise challenges by pairing a large language model with a real-time retrieval layer, grounding every answer in verifiable corporate data](https://www.enterprisetimes.co.uk/2025/07/02/retrieval-augmented-generation-becomes-the-enterprise-standard/). This approach slashes hallucinations while keeping fine-tuning costs down.

### Sub-Categories

**Enterprise Search:**
- AI-powered search across internal documents, databases, and applications
- Unified search across multiple data sources
- Context-aware retrieval with semantic understanding

**Knowledge Bases & Internal Wikis:**
- Centralized repositories for organizational knowledge
- Self-service information access for employees
- Documentation and process management

**Expert Systems & Q&A:**
- Conversational AI assistants for internal teams
- Customer support automation
- Domain-specific knowledge retrieval

**Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG):**
- [In 2025, RAG is not just a solution; it's the strategic imperative addressing core enterprise challenges](https://medium.com/@aaditya620321/retrieval-augmented-generation-rag-transforming-enterprise-ai-in-2025-18377ee963be)
- [Two years ago, most CIOs still treated RAG as an interesting lab experiment. Today, it has become the reference architecture for any production-grade GenAI system](https://www.enterprisetimes.co.uk/2025/07/02/retrieval-augmented-generation-becomes-the-enterprise-standard/)

### Industries with Highest Adoption

[Knowledge management is now one of the business functions with the most reported AI use](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/quantumblack/our-insights/the-state-of-ai).
