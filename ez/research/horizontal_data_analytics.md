## 4. BUILD VS. BUY ANALYSIS

### When Enterprises Build Custom Solutions

| Scenario | Rationale | Source |
|----------|-----------|--------|
| **Genuinely unique requirements** | Analytics central to competitive position; not commodity feature | [Build vs Buy Framework 2025](https://medium.com/@zaynmatthews4/embedded-analytics-the-ctos-2025-build-vs-buy-framework-d2ea23cceea2) |
| **Core differentiation** | Analytics capabilities are what customers actually buy from you | [Build vs Buy Framework 2025](https://medium.com/@zaynmatthews4/embedded-analytics-the-ctos-2025-build-vs-buy-framework-d2ea23cceea2) |
| **Specific data sovereignty requirements** | Regulatory or compliance needs prevent third-party solutions | [Build vs Buy Analytics](https://qrvey.com/blog/build-vs-buy-analytics/) |
| **Existing deep technical expertise** | In-house team capable of long-term maintenance and innovation | [Build vs Buy Analytics](https://qrvey.com/blog/build-vs-buy-analytics/) |

### When Enterprises Buy Solutions

| Scenario | Rationale | Source |
|----------|-----------|--------|
| **Platform meets 80%+ requirements** | Buying is cheaper and faster out of the box | [Build vs Buy Framework 2025](https://medium.com/@zaynmatthews4/embedded-analytics-the-ctos-2025-build-vs-buy-framework-d2ea23cceea2) |

AI agents learn organizational terminology and workflows for tailored, context-aware recommendations [Business Intelligence Trends 2025](https://improvado.io/blog/business-intelligence-trends)

### Semantic Layers as Non-Negotiable
Gartner 2025 guidance identifies semantic technology as non-negotiable for AI success. Exponential growth of generative AI has elevated semantic layer from convenience to necessity [Why Semantic Layers Replace Data Warehouses](https://www.knowi.com/blog/why-semantic-layers-are-replacing-traditional-data-warehouses-in-2025/)

### Real-Time Analytics
Critical for industries like financial services (portfolio analysis), retail (inventory optimization), and manufacturing (production monitoring). Modern semantic layers now incorporate streaming data support and low-latency query processing [Semantic Layer](https://www.atscale.com/glossary/semantic-layer/)

### Hybrid LLM + Semantic Model Approach
"The future of visualization natural language interfaces is not a generic, all-powerful LLM; it is a flexible LLM operating on top of a rigid, curated semantic model for governance, accuracy, and domain-specific knowledge" [Natural Language Visualization](https://towardsdatascience.com/natural-language-visualization-and-the-future-of-data-analysis-and-presentation/)

### Multi-Modal AI Integration
Integration of multiple LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Ollama) through universal APIs; specialized models for different tasks (schema understanding, SQL generation, validation) [LLM Models Text-to-SQL](https://promethium.ai/guides/llm-ai-models-text-to-sql/)
