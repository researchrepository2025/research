## Custom Build Patterns

### Build vs. Buy Trends

**Custom Build Adoption:**
- Data shows emerging shift toward custom building in 2025: "Law firms will finally gain a technology edge in 2025 with solutions they build themselves" - Myka L. Hopgood, Chief Knowledge Management and Innovation Officer at Dykema Gossett PLLC [8 Bold Legal Technology Predictions For 2025](https://www.law360.com/pulse/articles/2276506/8-bold-legal-technology-predictions-for-2025)
- Traditional trend: Legal tech vendors have convinced law firms to buy because it's easier and faster than developing internally, but this is changing in 2025 [8 Bold Legal Technology Predictions For 2025](https://www.law360.com/pulse/articles/2276506/8-bold-legal-technology-predictions-for-2025)
- Specific percentage of custom build vs. buy: Data not verified/available

**The Blended Approach (Most Common):**
"Across U.S. Fortune 500 firms, the pragmatic equilibrium is a blend: Buy platform capabilities (governance, audit trails, multi-model routing, RBAC, DLP, compliance attestations), and build the last mile: retrieval, tool adapters, evaluation datasets, hallucination tests, and sector-specific guardrails." [Build vs Buy for Enterprise AI 2025](https://www.marktechpost.com/2025/08/24/build-vs-buy-for-enterprise-ai-2025-a-u-s-market-decision-framework-for-vps-of-ai-product/)
