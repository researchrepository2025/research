## Custom Build vs. Buy Patterns

### Build vs. Buy Analysis (2025)

**Enterprise Approach:**
- **80/20 rule emerging:** 80% of AI needs met by purchased/subscription solutions, 20% addressed with custom builds where deep integration or unique IP is critical [ai.work](https://www.ai.work/blog/enterprise-ai-in-2025-an-80-20-balance-of-buy-vs-build)
- **Hybrid/Blend dominant:** Most Fortune 500 firms buying vendor platforms for governance, audit, compliance while building "last mile" custom retrieval, tool adapters, sector-specific guardrails [MarkTechPost](https://www.marktechpost.com/2025/08/24/build-vs-buy-for-enterprise-ai-2025-a-u-s-market-decision-framework-for-vps-of-ai-product/)

**Industry Preference:**
- Over **50% prefer to buy** resources, services, and capabilities rather than build in-house (Lenovo research) [InformationWeek](https://www.informationweek.com/machine-learning-ai/ai-buy-or-build-)
- However, **47% find it "significantly challenging"** to develop solutions tailored to their business [InformationWeek](https://www.informationweek.com/machine-learning-ai/ai-buy-or-build-)

**Cost Considerations:**
- Custom AI solutions: **$100,000 - $500,000+** for enterprise-grade implementations [Netguru](https://www.netguru.com/blog/build-vs-buy-ai)
- Off-the-shelf AI platforms: **$200-$400/month** subscriptions [Netguru](https://www.netguru.com/blog/build-vs-buy-ai)
- **65% of total costs** materialize after deployment [Netguru](https://www.netguru.com/blog/build-vs-buy-ai)
- Maintenance: **10-20% of AI budget**, enterprise systems requiring **$5,000-$20,000/month** [Netguru](https://www.netguru.com/blog/build-vs-buy-ai)

**When to Build:**
- Capability underpins competitive advantage
- Involves sensitive U.S. regulatory data (PHI, PII, financials)
- Demands deep integration into proprietary systems [MarkTechPost](https://www.marktechpost.com/2025/08/24/build-vs-buy-for-enterprise-ai-2025-a-u-s-market-decision-framework-for-vps-of-ai-product/)

**When to Buy:**
- Use case is commoditized
- Speed-to-value determines success [MarkTechPost](https://www.marktechpost.com/2025/08/24/build-vs-buy-for-enterprise-ai-2025-a-u-s-market-decision-framework-for-vps-of-ai-product/)

**Agriculture-Specific Insights:**
- Agriculture "particularly well suited for disruption by AI" due to high volumes of unstructured data, labor reliance, complex supply chains, long R&D cycles [McKinsey](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/agriculture/our-insights/from-bytes-to-bushels-how-gen-ai-can-shape-the-future-of-agriculture)
- Many underlying components can be reused to enable scale-up vs. buying monolithic applications [McKinsey](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/agriculture/our-insights/from-bytes-to-bushels-how-gen-ai-can-shape-the-future-of-agriculture)

- Agricultural systems for crop and soil monitoring [USDA](https://www.usda.gov/sites/default/files/documents/fy-2025-2026-usda-ai-strategy.pdf)

### Data Ownership Concerns

**Current State:**
- Most precision farming data is **non-personal data**, therefore **largely unregulated** [Vorys](https://www.vorys.com/publication-Understanding-the-Legal-Aspects-of-Precision-Farming-Data)
- Despite exponential increase in data regulation, agricultural data falls outside most frameworks

**Key Challenge:**
- "Who owns the data?" - Farmer, agricultural business, or other parties? [Number Analytics](https://www.numberanalytics.com/blog/data-privacy-agriculture-comprehensive-guide)
- Data collected and used by multiple parties creates complexity
- **In general, the farmer who collects the data is considered the owner**, but subject to contractual agreements [Number Analytics](https://www.numberanalytics.com/blog/data-privacy-agriculture-comprehensive-guide)

**Privacy Law Gaps:**
- GDPR (EU): Applies only when farm data includes personally identifiable information (PII); most agricultural data is non-personal and falls outside scope [Washington Journal of Law](https://wjlta.com/2025/02/25/the-legal-landscape-of-data-privacy-in-ai-driven-precision-agriculture/)
- CCPA (California): Similar limitations for non-personal agricultural data
- General privacy laws designed for personal data fall short in protecting complex operational farm data [Washington Journal of Law](https://wjlta.com/2025/02/25/the-legal-landscape-of-data-privacy-in-ai-driven-precision-agriculture/)

**State-Level Regulation:**
- Fragmented landscape with inconsistent regulations across states [Washington Journal of Law](https://wjlta.com/2025/02/25/the-legal-landscape-of-data-privacy-in-ai-driven-precision-agriculture/)
- **Nebraska LB525 - Agricultural Data Privacy Act** introduced 2025 [Measure Minds](https://measuremindsgroup.com/data-privacy-laws-in-2025)
- **Minnesota Agricultural Data statute:** Defines agricultural data as private, protecting University of Minnesota and MN Dept of Agriculture data from open access requests [Agronomy Journal](https://acsess.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/agj2.20968)
- **Eight new state privacy laws** taking effect in 2025 [Measure Minds](https://measuremindsgroup.com/data-privacy-laws-in-2025)

### Industry Self-Regulation

**American Farm Bureau Federation:**
- "Privacy and Security Principles" for Farm Data (voluntary guidelines)
- Key principles: Farmer ownership of agricultural data, transparency in data collection, robust security measures, clear disclosure in data-sharing agreements [Number Analytics](https://www.numberanalytics.com/blog/data-privacy-agriculture-comprehensive-guide)

**Ag Data Transparency Evaluator:**
- Voluntary assessment for U.S. farmers
- Helps understand how data will be used when adopting precision agriculture technologies
- Lacks enforcement mechanisms [Washington Journal of Law](https://wjlta.com/2025/02/25/the-legal-landscape-of-data-privacy-in-ai-driven-precision-agriculture/)

**International Codes:**
- **New Zealand Farm Data Code of Practice**
- **European Union Code of Conduct on Agricultural Data Sharing by Contractual Agreement**
- **Australian Farm Data Code**
- All voluntary and self-regulatory (may reduce effectiveness) [Sustainability Directory](https://sustainability-directory.com/question/what-data-privacy-laws-protect-farmers/)

### Environmental Compliance

**Conservation Funding:**
- **$9.5 billion in 2025**, **$11 billion in 2026** [Business Wire](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20251007600370/en/Syngenta-Crop-Protection-and-Taranis-Announce-Strategic-AI-Partnership)
- Programs: EQIP, CSP, 45Z tax credits
- Unprecedented support for sustainable practices

**Climate Initiatives:**

- AI platforms supporting Scope 3 emissions reductions

### Cybersecurity Challenges

**Data Security Concerns:**
- Digital agriculture under cybersecurity threats [Springer](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-032-01429-0_47)
- Need for robust security measures by agribusinesses
- Farmer concerns about data access by competitors

## Research Limitations and Data Gaps

### Data Not Verified/Available

The following data points could not be verified from 2025 sources:

1. **Specific Customer Lists:** Most vendors do not publicly disclose complete customer rosters
2. **Exact Pricing:** Many enterprise platforms use "contact sales" models without public pricing
3. **Market Share Percentages:** Specific vendor market share data often proprietary
4. **Adoption Rates by Specific Use Case:** While overall adoption rates available, breakdown by individual use case (e.g., % using disease detection specifically) not consistently reported
5. **Custom Build Percentage:** Exact percentage of enterprises building custom vs. buying in agriculture sector not found in 2025 sources
6. **Indigo Ag 2025 Updates:** Limited recent information on Indigo Ag customers and pricing
7. **Climate AI Details:** Minimal 2025 data on this vendor specifically
8. **Cordulus Details:** Mentioned in market overviews but detailed profile not available
9. **ROI by Farm Size for Specific Technologies:** Aggregate ROI available but not consistently broken down by farm size and technology type

### Source Date Caveats

- Some vendor information (e.g., Farmers Edge pricing, FarmWise Titan details) references 2018-2021 data as more recent updates not found
- Several acquisitions (Blue River 2017, Tule 2023) have historical context but 2025 operational details limited
- Industry reports often cite 2024 as "most recent year" with 2025 as projections
