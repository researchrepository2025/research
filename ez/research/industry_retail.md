## Custom Build vs Buy Patterns

### Build vs Buy Breakdown

#### When Enterprises Buy (Majority Pattern)
- **Primary Approach:** **Buy (or Buy + Customize)** is the dominant pattern for retail AI
- **Rationale:** Speed to value, vendor-provided compliance coverage, proven ROI patterns
- **Typical Use Cases:** Personalization, chatbots, inventory management, fraud detection (commoditized use cases)

#### When Enterprises Build
- **Build Scenarios:** When capability underpins competitive advantage, involves sensitive regulatory data (PHI, PII, financials), or demands deep integration into proprietary systems [Build vs Buy AI](https://www.netguru.com/blog/build-vs-buy-ai)
- **Example:** H&M began with generic AI chatbots but invested in proprietary "Fountainhead" platform for flexibility and control [Build vs Buy AI](https://www.netguru.com/blog/build-vs-buy-ai)
- **Building for differentiation:** Retail companies building AI that deeply understands customer lifecycle and local purchasing habits provides differentiation hard to replicate with off-the-shelf tools [Build vs Buy AI](https://www.netguru.com/blog/build-vs-buy-ai)

#### The Hybrid/Blended Approach (Most Common)
- **Pattern:** For majority of U.S. enterprise use cases, a **blended approach** works best: pairing proven vendor platforms (multi-model routing, safety layers, compliance) with custom "last mile" work on prompts, retrieval, orchestration, and domain evaluations [Build vs Buy Enterprise AI](https://www.marktechpost.com/2025/08/24/build-vs-buy-for-enterprise-ai-2025-a-u-s-market-decision-framework-for-vps-of-ai-product/)
- **Rationale:** Balance between speed, cost, and customization

### Cost Considerations

- Maintenance typically consumes **10-20%** of AI budget, with enterprise systems requiring **$5,000-$20,000 monthly** [Build vs Buy AI](https://www.netguru.com/blog/build-vs-buy-ai)
- Compliance requirements add **$10,000-$100,000 annually**, especially in regulated industries [Build vs Buy AI](https://www.netguru.com/blog/build-vs-buy-ai)
- **Surprising stat:** 65% of total software costs occur **after** original deployment [Build vs Buy AI](https://www.netguru.com/blog/build-vs-buy-ai)

#### Off-the-Shelf Costs
- Off-the-shelf AI platforms often start with monthly subscriptions of **$200-$400** [Custom AI vs Off-the-Shelf](https://appinventiv.com/blog/custom-ai-vs-off-the-shelf-ai/)

## Regulatory Considerations

### Consumer Privacy Regulations

#### CCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act) AI Regulations
- **New 2025 Regulations:** On July 24, 2025, California Privacy Protection Agency (CPPA) approved rulemaking package imposing substantial new compliance obligations on businesses using AI and automated decision-making technologies (ADMT) [CCPA AI Regulations](https://www.wsgr.com/en/insights/cppa-approves-new-ccpa-regulations-on-ai-cybersecurity-and-risk-governance-and-advances-updated-data-broker-regulations.html)
- **ADMT Definition:** Any technology that processes personal information and uses computation to replace or substantially replace human decision-making [CCPA AI Regulations IBM](https://www.ibm.com/think/news/ccpa-ai-automation-regulations)
- **Requirements:** Businesses using ADMT for "significant decisions" must fulfill notice, opt-out, and access request obligations [CCPA AI Regulations IBM](https://www.ibm.com/think/news/ccpa-ai-automation-regulations)
- **Right to Appeal:** Under CCPA § 7221(b), companies not required to offer right to appeal unless they also deny opt-out option. This undermines consumers' ability to challenge decisions made by opaque systems [AI Gets Personal CCPA vs GDPR](https://btlj.org/2025/04/ccpa-vs-gdpr-on-automated-decision-making/)

#### GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)
- **Automated Decision-Making:** GDPR Article 22(3) provides unconditional right to human review of automated decisions and detailed explanation of algorithm's rationale [AI Gets Personal CCPA vs GDPR](https://btlj.org/2025/04/ccpa-vs-gdpr-on-automated-decision-making/)
- **Global Impact:** Many companies subject to CCPA are also governed by GDPR due to global nature of digital commerce. Divergences increase compliance costs and create regulatory uncertainty [AI Gets Personal CCPA vs GDPR](https://btlj.org/2025/04/ccpa-vs-gdpr-on-automated-decision-making/)
- **2025 Baseline:** Principles of GDPR and CCPA are now the baseline, not the ceiling. 2025 sees enforcement of new wave of U.S. state privacy laws in Texas, Oregon, and Montana [Compliance Challenges AI GDPR](https://secureprivacy.ai/blog/ai-gdpr-compliance-challenges-2025)

### Price Discrimination & Algorithmic Pricing

#### U.S. State-Level Price Discrimination Laws
- **New York S 3008:** Went into effect July 8, 2025, requiring disclosure: "THIS PRICE WAS SET BY AN ALGORITHM USING YOUR PERSONAL DATA" for personalized algorithmic pricing [Price to Pay U.S. Lawmaker Efforts](https://fpf.org/blog/a-price-to-pay-u-s-lawmaker-efforts-to-regulate-algorithmic-and-data-driven-pricing/)
- **Legal Challenge:** National Retail Federation filed lawsuit to block the law, alleging First Amendment violation. NY Attorney General agreed to pause enforcement for 30 days after preliminary injunction decision [Price to Pay U.S. Lawmaker Efforts](https://fpf.org/blog/a-price-to-pay-u-s-lawmaker-efforts-to-regulate-algorithmic-and-data-driven-pricing/)
- **California AB 446:** Would prohibit "surveillance pricing" based on personally identifiable information (aligned with CCPA text in current version) [Price to Pay U.S. Lawmaker Efforts](https://fpf.org/blog/a-price-to-pay-u-s-lawmaker-efforts-to-regulate-algorithmic-and-data-driven-pricing/)
- **Focus Areas:** Bills target "algorithmic," "surveillance," and "dynamic" pricing involving personal data, AI deployment, and/or frequent changes, particularly in critical sectors like food and housing [Price to Pay U.S. Lawmaker Efforts](https://fpf.org/blog/a-price-to-pay-u-s-lawmaker-efforts-to-regulate-algorithmic-and-data-driven-pricing/)

#### FTC Investigation
- **FTC 6(b) Study:** FTC announced in 2024 conducting investigation to study how firms engage in "surveillance pricing," with preliminary insights released in early 2025 [Price to Pay U.S. Lawmaker Efforts](https://fpf.org/blog/a-price-to-pay-u-s-lawmaker-efforts-to-regulate-algorithmic-and-data-driven-pricing/)
- **New FTC Leadership:** New leadership signaled continuing the study is not a priority, prompting state lawmakers to step in [Price to Pay U.S. Lawmaker Efforts](https://fpf.org/blog/a-price-to-pay-u-s-lawmaker-efforts-to-regulate-algorithmic-and-data-driven-pricing/)

### Transparency Requirements

#### Consumer Expectations & Rights
- **Information Rights:** Both CCPA and GDPR allow consumers to request information about logic behind ADMTs and likely outcome of a decision [AI Gets Personal CCPA vs GDPR](https://btlj.org/2025/04/ccpa-vs-gdpr-on-automated-decision-making/)
- **Explainability Challenge:** When rules vary across jurisdictions, companies either over-comply (wasting resources) or under-comply (exposing themselves to enforcement, litigation, or reputational fallout) [AI Gets Personal CCPA vs GDPR](https://btlj.org/2025/04/ccpa-vs-gdpr-on-automated-decision-making/)

### Compliance Best Practices

#### Key Considerations for Retail AI
1. **Multi-Jurisdictional Compliance:** Assume GDPR, CCPA, and emerging state laws all apply
2. **Transparency First:** Provide clear disclosures about AI use in pricing, personalization, and decision-making
3. **Human-in-the-Loop:** Maintain ability for human review of significant automated decisions
4. **Data Minimization:** Collect only necessary personal data for AI systems
5. **Opt-Out Mechanisms:** Provide consumers ability to opt out of AI-driven decisions
6. **Regular Audits:** Conduct cybersecurity audits and risk assessments as required by new CCPA regulations
7. **Documentation:** Maintain detailed records of AI logic, data sources, and decision processes
