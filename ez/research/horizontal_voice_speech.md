- [In human conversation, responses typically arrive within 500ms, setting the gold standard for natural interaction](https://www.retellai.com/resources/ai-voice-agent-latency-face-off-2025)
- [Humans expect near-instantaneous responses, typically within 300-500 milliseconds](https://tringtring.ai/blog/technical-deep-dive/understanding-latency-in-ai-voice-agents-why-sub-500ms-matters/)
- [Average human reaction time is around 220 milliseconds](https://www.retellai.com/resources/ai-voice-agent-latency-face-off-2025)

**Industry Production Targets:**
- [Production voice AI agents typically aim for 800ms or lower latency to maintain conversational flow](https://tringtring.ai/blog/technical-deep-dive/understanding-latency-in-ai-voice-agents-why-sub-500ms-matters/)
- [If your voice agent takes longer than 800ms to respond, you're already losing the conversation](https://tringtring.ai/blog/technical-deep-dive/understanding-latency-in-ai-voice-agents-why-sub-500ms-matters/)
- [The difference between 300ms and 800ms can mean the difference between natural conversation and frustrating robotic interaction](https://www.phonely.ai/blogs/performance-reliability-in-voice-ai-why-sub-second-latency-matters)

**Critical Degradation Points:**
- [Even pauses as short as ~300 milliseconds can feel unnatural](https://telnyx.com/resources/low-latency-voice-ai)
- [Any latency beyond ~1.5 seconds can rapidly degrade the experience](https://telnyx.com/resources/low-latency-voice-ai)
- [Contact centers report customers hang up 40% more frequently when voice agents take longer than 1 second to respond](https://tringtring.ai/blog/technical-deep-dive/understanding-latency-in-ai-voice-agents-why-sub-500ms-matters/)

#### Network Latency Budget

**Telephony (PSTN) Overhead:**
- [On telephony network (PSTN), roughly 500ms of latency is introduced across the call path](https://blog.webex.com/engineering/building-voice-ai-that-can-keep-up-with-real-conversations/)
- [This leaves only a few hundred milliseconds for turn detection, retrieval, reasoning, and speech synthesis](https://blog.webex.com/engineering/building-voice-ai-that-can-keep-up-with-real-conversations/)
- [Webex AI Agent consistently achieves ~1.3 second PSTN latencies over real telephony paths](https://www.retellai.com/resources/ai-voice-agent-latency-face-off-2025)

**Network Traversals:**
- [To generate single response, cascaded agent requires at least ten network traversals](https://www.retellai.com/resources/ai-voice-agent-latency-face-off-2025)
- [Two voice legs over public network (internet or PSTN)](https://www.retellai.com/resources/ai-voice-agent-latency-face-off-2025)
- [Eight inter-service handoffs](https://www.retellai.com/resources/ai-voice-agent-latency-face-off-2025)

#### Component-Level Latency Targets

- [Retell AI: 500ms latency](https://www.retellai.com/blog/vapi-ai-review)
- [Twilio Voice: 950ms average (optimized for reliability/global reach over speed)](https://www.retellai.com/resources/sub-second-latency-voice-assistants-benchmarks)

#### Optimization Strategies

**Cost vs. Latency Trade-offs:**
- [Many teams unknowingly stream everything "for simplicity," paying 30-50% more than needed](https://deepgram.com/learn/speech-to-text-api-pricing-breakdown-2025)
- [Simple switch to batch for non-interactive traffic often halves the bill](https://deepgram.com/learn/speech-to-text-api-pricing-breakdown-2025)
- Streaming APIs cost more but provide necessary latency for real-time
- Batch APIs cheaper but unsuitable for live conversations

**Performance Metrics:**
- [Three metrics determine voice agent performance: speed (time to first token), accuracy (word error rate), processing efficiency (real-time factor)](https://www.videosdk.live/developer-hub/llm/cerebras-voice-agent)
- [Perceptual latency: The delay as perceived by user, typically anything above 300ms degrades experience](https://www.videosdk.live/developer-hub/llm/cerebras-voice-agent)
