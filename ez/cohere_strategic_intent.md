# Cohere AI Building Platform - Strategic Intent
## Date Range: August 1, 2025 - January 13, 2026

### Executive Summary
Cohere is positioning itself as an enterprise-first AI building platform provider focused on "ROI not AGI," directly competing with hyperscaler platforms like AWS Bedrock, Azure AI Foundry, and Google Vertex AI. The company's strategic intent centers on three core pillars: (1) North Platform as a complete AI workspace for secure enterprise building, (2) multi-cloud and sovereign deployment flexibility across all major cloud providers and on-premises environments, and (3) privacy-first architecture enabling enterprises in regulated industries to deploy AI without exposing sensitive data. Cohere doubled ARR to $100M in H1 2025 and reached $7B valuation through $600M in funding across August-September 2025, with 85% of revenue from private deployments serving finance, healthcare, and government sectors.

### Strategic Themes Identified
1. **Platform Completeness Over Model Leadership** - Positioning North as a full-stack AI workspace combining models, RAG, search, and agents versus point solutions
2. **Enterprise Privacy as Competitive Moat** - Private deployment (VPC, on-prem, air-gapped) as primary differentiator versus cloud-locked competitors
3. **Multi-Cloud Freedom vs Vendor Lock-in** - Available across AWS, GCP, Azure, Oracle as a strategic positioning versus hyperscaler platforms
4. **Sovereign AI for Government/Regulated Industries** - Data residency and compliance-first platform strategy targeting sectors unable to use consumer AI services
5. **Vertical Platform Specialization** - Industry-specific North variants (Banking, EU Cloud) versus horizontal general platforms
