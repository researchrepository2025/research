# AWS AI Platform Summary
## August 1, 2025 - January 13, 2026

### Executive Overview
AWS executed a comprehensive strategic pivot toward agentic AI during this period, positioning AI agents as "the new cloud" and committing over $100 billion in AI infrastructure investment. The company launched Amazon Nova 2 model family with breakthrough reasoning capabilities, deployed Trainium3 chips achieving 50%+ token processing on Bedrock, and operationalized Project Rainier—the world's largest non-NVIDIA AI compute cluster with nearly 500,000 chips. AWS achieved 20% YoY growth (highest in 11 quarters) reaching a $132 billion annualized run rate, with AI-specific revenue at multi-billion dollar scale growing at triple-digit percentages. Strategic focus centered on three pillars: cost-performance leadership through custom silicon, production-ready agentic AI through Bedrock AgentCore, and hybrid infrastructure addressing sovereignty requirements.
