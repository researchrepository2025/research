# F17: Azure Data Services
**Research Question:** What managed data services does Azure provide for databases, caching, search, and storage, and what operational burden does each eliminate?

---

## Executive Summary

Azure provides a comprehensive portfolio of managed data services that systematically eliminate the operational overhead associated with self-hosted infrastructure — covering relational databases, NoSQL stores, distributed caching, full-text and vector search, analytics warehousing, and tiered object storage. Azure SQL Database delivers a 99.999% SLA with zone redundancy enabled, automatic index tuning driven by AI, and built-in geo-replication — replacing dedicated DBA time for patching, failover configuration, and query plan monitoring. Azure Cosmos DB provides planet-scale global distribution with 99.999% read/write availability and five tunable consistency models, removing the engineering complexity of multi-region replication. Azure Managed Redis (now the strategic successor to Azure Cache for Redis) runs on the Redis Enterprise stack and provides sub-millisecond caching with up to 99.999% availability via active geo-replication. Azure AI Search natively combines BM25 keyword search, vector search, and semantic re-ranking in a single managed pipeline, eliminating the need to operate separate search and embedding infrastructure. For ISVs deploying AI-driven SaaS applications, these services collectively represent a path to a 1–3 FTE reduction in platform engineering headcount compared to equivalent self-hosted stacks.

## 1. Azure SQL Database

### Overview and Managed Capabilities

Azure SQL Database is a fully managed relational database built on SQL Server, available as a PaaS offering. [Microsoft documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-sql/database/automatic-tuning-overview?view=azuresql) describes it as "a fully managed intelligent performance service that continuously monitors queries executed on a database, and automatically improves performance."

**What the service eliminates operationally:**
- OS and SQL Server patching and version upgrades
- Manual failover configuration and replication topology management
- Query plan regression monitoring and index analysis
- Backup scheduling and restore testing

### Elastic Pools

Elastic pools allow multiple databases to share a common pool of compute and storage resources, optimizing cost when databases have variable usage patterns. [Microsoft Azure pricing documentation](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/azure-sql-database/elastic/) and associated documentation confirm that Hyperscale elastic pools are now generally available. Within a Hyperscale elastic pool, each high-availability configuration creates an equivalent and independent set of compute and log resources, supporting up to four high-availability replicas sharing the same compute size as the primary.

### Serverless Compute Tier

The serverless compute tier automatically scales compute resources based on workload demand and can auto-pause during idle periods, charging only for compute used. [Microsoft Learn documentation on serverless](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-sql/database/serverless-tier-overview?view=azuresql) states the tier is "price-performance optimized for single databases with intermittent, unpredictable usage patterns that can afford some delay in compute warm-up after idle usage periods."

**ISV relevance:** Development and staging environments, infrequently accessed tenant databases in multi-tenant ISV architectures.

### Active Geo-Replication

Active geo-replication enables continuously synchronized readable geo-secondary databases. [Microsoft's SLA documentation](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/support/legal/sla/sql-database/v1_4/) confirms:
- Standard SLA: **99.99%** uptime for all service tiers
- Zone-redundant Business Critical tier: **99.995%** uptime (maximum downtime of 26.28 minutes per year, a 50% reduction versus the standard SLA)

There is no additional data transfer charge for data generated by active geo-replication between the primary and geo-secondary databases.

### Auto-Tuning: Three Core Options

[Microsoft Learn automatic tuning documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-sql/database/automatic-tuning-overview?view=azuresql) (updated 2025-03-19) specifies three automatic tuning options:

| Option | Behavior | Default State |
|--------|-----------|---------------|
| `FORCE_LAST_GOOD_PLAN` | Detects query plan regressions; forces execution using the last known good plan | **Enabled** |
| `CREATE_INDEX` | Identifies beneficial indexes; creates them; auto-validates performance improvement | Disabled |
| `DROP_INDEX` | Drops indexes unused for more than 90 days and duplicate indexes | Disabled |

Key operational facts from the same source:
- Tuning recommendations applied only during periods of low CPU, Data IO, and Log IO utilization
- Validation window: 30 minutes to 72 hours depending on query execution frequency
- If regression is detected during validation, changes are reverted immediately
- Tuning history retained for 21 days
- "Automatic tuning mechanisms are mature and have been perfected on several million databases running on Azure"

## 2. Azure Cosmos DB

### Overview

Azure Cosmos DB is Microsoft's globally distributed, multi-model database. [Microsoft's official Cosmos DB introduction page](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/introduction) describes it as a "unified AI database for data models like relational, document, vector, key-value, graph, and table." It provides native wire-protocol compatible support for NoSQL (SQL API), Cassandra (CQL), MongoDB, Table Storage, and Gremlin APIs.

### Global Distribution

[Microsoft's global distribution documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/distribute-data-globally) specifies:
- **99.999% read and write availability** for multi-region databases
- Reads and writes guaranteed in **less than 10 milliseconds** at the 99th percentile
- Operates across more than **50 geographical regions**
- Tens of thousands of customers have configured databases replicated across 2 to 50+ regions
- Zero downtime with multi-region writes or RPO=0 when using Strong consistency

**Operational burden eliminated:** Multi-region replication topology setup, conflict resolution logic, cross-region failover runbooks, latency optimization across geographies.

### Five Consistency Levels

[Microsoft's consistency documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/distribute-data-globally) confirms five tunable consistency models:

| Level | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Strong | Linearizability; reads guaranteed to return most recent committed version |
| Bounded Staleness | Reads lag behind writes by at most K versions or T time interval |
| Session | Consistent-prefix within a single client session (default for most applications) |
| Consistent Prefix | Updates returned in order; no out-of-order reads |
| Eventual | Highest availability and throughput; weakest consistency guarantee |

### Serverless Tier

[Microsoft's Cosmos DB serverless documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/serverless) and [pricing page](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/cosmos-db/serverless/) specify:
- Charged only for Request Units (RUs) consumed and storage used
- **$0.25 per 1 million RUs** (East US region)
- **$0.25 per GB per month** transactional storage
- No minimum operations; no capacity planning required
- **Limitation:** Serverless accounts run in a **single Azure region only** — global distribution requires provisioned throughput accounts

### Request Unit (RU) Pricing Model

The RU model abstracts compute, memory, and I/O into a single normalized currency. [Turbo360's Cosmos DB pricing guide](https://turbo360.com/blog/azure-cosmos-db-cost-pricing) confirms the pay-per-request billing model eliminates the need to pre-provision server capacity while providing a direct cost signal per database operation.

## 3. Azure Cache for Redis / Azure Managed Redis

### Product Transition Note

Azure is actively transitioning from Azure Cache for Redis to Azure Managed Redis (AMR). [Microsoft's retirement announcement](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/azure-managed-redis/azure-cache-for-redis-retirement-what-to-know-and-how-to-prepare/4458721) states:
- Azure Cache for Redis (Basic, Standard, Premium tiers): retiring **September 30, 2028**
- Azure Cache for Redis (Enterprise tier): retiring **March 30, 2027**
- Azure Managed Redis is now generally available as the strategic replacement

### Azure Managed Redis Architecture

[Microsoft Learn's AMR architecture documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/redis/architecture) and [Redis.io's AMR announcement](https://redis.io/blog/introducing-azure-managed-redis/) confirm:
- Runs on the **Redis Enterprise stack** (not community Redis)
- Community Redis is single-threaded; Enterprise stack eliminates this bottleneck
- Azure-first-party offering: provisioned, managed, and billed like native Azure services, no Marketplace transaction required
- **Microsoft Entra ID authentication** available at cache creation time
- Introduces eight new data structures: JSON, vector, time series, and five probabilistic types

### Enterprise Tier: Clustering and Performance

[Microsoft Learn's Enterprise tier best practices](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-cache-for-redis/cache-best-practices-enterprise-tiers) document:
- Enterprise and Enterprise Flash tiers are inherently clustered
- Two clustering policies: **OSS** (recommended for most applications; higher maximum throughput) and **Enterprise**
- Workloads can scale up to **1.2 TB** via automatic sharding across up to 10 Redis nodes

### Active Geo-Replication

[Microsoft Learn's active geo-replication documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-cache-for-redis/cache-how-to-active-geo-replication) specifies:
- Active geo-replication groups up to **five Enterprise Azure Cache for Redis instances** into a single cache spanning Azure regions
- Both primary and replica caches support **reads and writes** (active-active)
- Enabling active geo-replication with zone redundancy increases availability to **99.999%**
- Limitation: active geo-replication not supported on E1 and Flash SKUs

## 4. Azure AI Search

### Overview

Azure AI Search is a fully managed cloud search service combining full-text (BM25) keyword search, dense vector search, and semantic re-ranking in a unified managed pipeline.

### Vector Search

[Microsoft Learn vector search documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/search/vector-search-overview) confirms:
- Supports dense vector fields in search indexes
- Compatible with OpenAI embeddings (`text-embedding-ada-002`, `text-embedding-3-small`, `text-embedding-3-large`) via integrated vectorization
- Text Split skill for chunking and Azure OpenAI Embedding skill for vectorization are available in skillset pipelines

### Semantic Ranking

[Microsoft Learn semantic ranking documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/search/semantic-search-overview) specifies:
- Applies a secondary re-ranking pass over initial BM25 or RRF results
- Assigns a `@search.rerankerScore` ranging from **0 to 4** (high to low semantic relevance)
- Works on top of BM25-ranked text results or RRF-ranked hybrid results

### Hybrid Search

[Microsoft Learn hybrid search documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/search/hybrid-search-overview) confirms:
- Executes vector search and keyword search in a single API request
- Both queries run in parallel; results merged and reordered using **Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF)**
- Advantage: captures both semantic similarity (vector) and exact-match precision (keyword) simultaneously

### Skillsets and Enrichment Pipelines

[Microsoft Learn AI enrichment documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/search/cognitive-search-concept-intro) specifies that a skillset is "a reusable object in Azure AI Search that's attached to an indexer and contains one or more skills that call built-in AI or external custom processing over raw content." Supported pipeline capabilities include:
- **OCR**: Optical character recognition for image files (printed and handwritten text)
- **Text Split**: Document chunking for embedding workflows
- **Azure OpenAI Embedding**: Integrated vectorization without external API calls from application code
- **Document Layout skill**: In public preview (requires `2025-03-01-preview` API); for structured document parsing

**Operational burden eliminated:** Operating separate Elasticsearch clusters, maintaining embedding generation pipelines, managing vector index updates, coordinating BM25 and vector result merging in application code.

## 5. Azure Synapse Analytics

### Overview

Azure Synapse Analytics is an integrated analytics platform combining dedicated SQL pools (data warehouse), serverless SQL, and Apache Spark pools within a single workspace.

### Relationship to Microsoft Fabric

[Microsoft Fabric Blog (2025)](https://blog.fabric.microsoft.com/en-US/blog/two-years-on-how-fabric-redefines-the-modernization-path-for-synapse-users/) confirms that Microsoft Fabric is the strategic evolution of Azure Synapse. Microsoft has not announced Synapse retirement, but Fabric is where new innovation is concentrated. A Fabric Migration Assistant for Data Warehouse provides automated migration from Synapse dedicated SQL pools. **Note:** Azure Synapse Data Explorer (Preview) retires **October 7, 2025**.

### Dedicated SQL Pool (Data Warehouse)

Dedicated SQL pools use Data Warehouse Units (DWUs) as the compute billing unit. [Azure Synapse Analytics pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/synapse-analytics/) and [Microsoft Learn cost management documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/synapse-analytics/plan-manage-costs) confirm:
- Reserved capacity discounts: up to **65% savings** vs. pay-as-you-go pricing on 1-year or 3-year terms
- Compute can be **paused** when not in use; only data storage charges accrue during pause
- DWU billing is per-hour based on provisioned capacity

### Serverless SQL Pool

[Microsoft Learn serverless SQL pool documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/synapse-analytics/sql/on-demand-workspace-overview) specifies:
- "No infrastructure to setup or clusters to maintain"
- Default endpoint provided in every Azure Synapse workspace
- Pay only for data processed by queries; true pay-per-use model
- Supports querying: Azure Data Lake (Parquet, Delta Lake, delimited text), Azure Cosmos DB, and Dataverse

## 6. Azure Blob Storage

### Storage Tiers

[Microsoft Learn access tiers documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/access-tiers-overview) and [Azure Blob Storage pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/storage/blobs/) define four tiers:

| Tier | Storage Cost | Minimum Retention | Access Pattern |
|------|-------------|-------------------|----------------|
| Hot | ~$0.018/GB/month (first 50 TB) | None | Frequently accessed |
| Cool | ~$0.010/GB/month | 30 days | Infrequently accessed |
| Cold | ~$0.0036/GB/month | 90 days | Rarely accessed; fast retrieval required |
| Archive | ~$0.00099/GB/month | 180 days | Offline; retrieval takes hours |

Note: Azure requires blobs to pass through either Cool or Cold tier before reaching Archive. Direct Hot-to-Archive transitions are not supported.

### Lifecycle Management

[Microsoft Learn lifecycle management documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/lifecycle-management-overview) confirms:
- Rule-based policy engine that automatically transitions blobs between tiers based on last-modified or last-accessed date conditions
- Can also expire (delete) data at end-of-life

**Operational burden eliminated:** Manual data auditing and re-tiering scripts, storage cost overruns from forgotten hot-tier data, lifecycle compliance enforcement.

### Versioning

[Microsoft Learn blob versioning](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/lifecycle-management-overview) confirms that blob storage versioning can automatically maintain previous versions of objects, and lifecycle policies can be applied to tier or expire previous versions.

### Immutability (WORM)

[Microsoft Learn immutable storage documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/immutable-storage-overview) and [Microsoft's financial services compliance blog](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/microsoft-azure-launches-tamper-proof-azure-immutable-blob-storage-for-financial-services/) confirm:
- Two immutability modes: **container-level WORM** and **version-level WORM**
- Two policy types: **time-based retention** (WORM state for a specified interval) and **legal hold**
- Validated by Cohasset Associates as meeting: **CFTC Rule 1.31(c)-(d)**, **FINRA Rule 4511**, and **SEC Rule 17a-4(f)**
- Immutability blocks overwrites and deletions; tier transitions (including Archive rehydration) are still permitted under a locked immutability policy

### Comparison Table — Azure Blob Storage

| Capability | On-Premises | Managed K8s | Cloud-Native (Blob Storage) |
|------------|-------------|-------------|------------------------------|

- Soft delete and point-in-time snapshots for NFS file shares (now generally available)

### Azure NetApp Files

Azure NetApp Files (ANF) is a fully managed, enterprise-grade file storage service built on NetApp ONTAP technology. [Microsoft Learn's ANF introduction](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-netapp-files/azure-netapp-files-introduction) and [Microsoft Learn's service levels documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-netapp-files/azure-netapp-files-service-levels) specify five service levels:

| Service Level | Throughput per TiB |
|--------------|-------------------|
| Standard | 32 MiB/s per TiB |
| Premium | 64 MiB/s per TiB |
| Ultra | 128 MiB/s per TiB |
| Flexible | Independently configurable (minimum 128 MiB/s regardless of pool quota) |
| Elastic | 32 MiB/s per TiB |

For large volumes (all tiers), maximum throughput limit is **12,800 MiB/s**.

**Recent 2025 capabilities** (from [Microsoft Learn ANF What's New](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-netapp-files/whats-new)):
- Windows Server 2025 domain controller integration for SMB and dual-protocol volumes

## Key Takeaways

- **Azure SQL Database's auto-tuning is production-proven at scale:** Microsoft's AI-driven automatic tuning has been "perfected on several million databases" and replaces DBA-intensive index analysis cycles, validating and reverting changes automatically within 30–72 hours — directly reducing database engineering FTE requirements for ISV SaaS platforms.

- **Cosmos DB is the only natively multi-model, globally distributed managed database with a 99.999% SLA:** No self-hosted or managed Kubernetes database stack can match its operational simplicity for multi-region active-active deployments — a capability that otherwise requires specialized distributed systems engineering teams.

- **Azure Managed Redis on the Redis Enterprise stack eliminates single-threaded community Redis limitations:** With 99.999% availability via active geo-replication across up to five instances and native vector database support (benchmarked as fastest in market via Redis Connector for Azure Semantic Store), AMR is the strategic Redis tier for AI SaaS workloads going forward.

- **Azure AI Search collapses three operational concerns into one managed service:** Replacing separately operated Elasticsearch (full-text), vector database (semantic), and re-ranking model serving infrastructure with a single API endpoint — critical for ISVs building RAG-based AI features without a dedicated platform team.

- **Azure Blob Storage's four-tier lifecycle system and WORM compliance directly address ISV data retention requirements:** Regulatory-validated immutability (SEC Rule 17a-4(f), FINRA Rule 4511, CFTC Rule 1.31) and automated lifecycle tiering to Archive ($0.00099/GB/month) eliminate both compliance engineering and storage cost overruns at scale.
