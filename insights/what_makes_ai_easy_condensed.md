3. **DEPLOY with automation** → One-click + configuration-driven
4. **OPERATE with intelligence** → Self-healing + automated governance
5. **ADOPT with enablement** → Embedded training + workflow redesign

**Critical Success Factors:**

- **Focus beats breadth:** 3.5 use cases vs. 6.1 achieves 2.1x ROI
- **Redesign beats bolt-on:** 3x more likely to see returns when redesigning workflows
- **Strategy beats ad-hoc:** 80% success with formal strategy vs. 37% without

## What This Means for Executives

**AI adoption ease is inversely proportional to:**
Manual work required | Custom development needed | Specialized skills demanded | Time to value | Outcome uncertainty

**AI adoption ease is directly proportional to:**
Automation depth | Standard utilization | Self-service capability | Training accessibility | Outcome predictability

Making AI easy isn't about simplifying technology—it's about building capabilities that eliminate friction at every lifecycle stage. These 10 components with 22 critical aspects represent what must be easy for AI to move from pilot to production to performance.
