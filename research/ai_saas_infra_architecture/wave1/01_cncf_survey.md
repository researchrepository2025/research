# CNCF Survey Data: Cloud-Native and Kubernetes Adoption

## Executive Summary

CNCF Annual Surveys (2021-2024) provide extensive data on Kubernetes production adoption, managed service usage, and cloud-native architecture patterns. Kubernetes production adoption grew from 66% (2023) to 80% (2024). Managed Kubernetes services dominate with 79% of organizations using certified hosted platforms (2021) and 90% of Kubernetes users leveraging cloud-managed services. AI/ML workload adoption on Kubernetes stands at 66% for generative AI inference, though 44% of organizations do not yet run AI/ML workloads on Kubernetes. Data segmentation by company size, region, and maturity level exists, but SaaS-specific or AI SaaS vertical breakdowns are not explicitly reported in publicly available survey excerpts.

## Preliminary Estimates

### DIRECT: Managed vs Self-Managed Kubernetes Split

**Based on CNCF 2021 Survey:**
- 79% use certified managed Kubernetes platforms (Direct)
- ~21% self-managed (Derived: 100% - 79%)

**Based on CNCF 2024 Survey:**
- 59% on-premises + public cloud deployments "skewing heavily toward self-managed"
- 46% managed public cloud
- Note: Percentages overlap due to multi-deployment environments

**Based on Datadog 2021:**
- 90% of Kubernetes users leverage cloud-managed services (Direct)
- ~10% self-managed only (Derived: 100% - 90%)

**Reconciliation Note:** The 2021 data (79% managed via CNCF, 90% managed via Datadog) suggests strong managed service adoption. The 2024 CNCF data shows nuance with multi-environment deployments where organizations use BOTH managed and self-managed instances.

---

### DIRECT: AI/ML Workload Kubernetes Adoption

**For Organizations Hosting Generative AI Models:**
- 66% use Kubernetes for some/all inference workloads (Direct)
- 34% do not use Kubernetes for inference (Derived: 100% - 66%)

**For All Organizations:**
- 44% do not run AI/ML workloads on Kubernetes (Direct)
- 56% run some AI/ML workloads on Kubernetes (Derived: 100% - 44%)

---

### DIRECT: Cloud-Native Non-K8s Managed Services

**Serverless/FaaS Adoption:**
- 11% use serverless frameworks (2024, Direct)
- 13% used serverless in 2023 (Direct)
- 22% used serverless in 2022 (Direct)

**Container-as-a-Service:**
- No explicit percentage for CaaS without Kubernetes in CNCF surveys
- 93% have Kubernetes engagement (2024), leaving 7% using containers without Kubernetes or no containers

---

## Data Quality Assessment

### Completeness: 7/10

**Strong Coverage:**
- Kubernetes production adoption trends (2021-2024)
- Managed vs self-managed high-level splits
- AI/ML workload adoption on Kubernetes
- Company size segmentation
- Regional geographic segmentation
- Cloud provider multi-cloud patterns

**Missing Coverage:**
- Industry vertical breakdowns (SaaS, Financial Services, Healthcare, etc.)
- Revenue-based company segmentation (only employee count)
- Explicit "AI SaaS company" segment
- Detailed serverless/PaaS vs Kubernetes trade-off analysis
- Cost-based decision factors for managed vs self-managed

---

### Recency: 9/10

- 2024 CNCF Annual Survey published April 2025 (excellent)
- 2023 CNCF Annual Survey published December 2023 (good)
- 2021 CNCF Annual Survey published February 2022 (older but valuable for trends)
- Survey methodology is annual with consistent timing
- AI/ML specific questions added in 2024 survey (timely)

---

### Sample Size: 8/10

**2024 Survey:**
- n=750 respondents (adequate)
- Margin of error not stated

**2023 Survey:**
- n=988 respondents (good)
- ±2.6% margin of error at 90% confidence level
- 3,735 initial candidates, 988 after quality screening

**2021 Survey:**
- n=3,800 respondents (excellent)

**Assessment:** Sample sizes are adequate for general population statistics but may be insufficient for deep segmentation (e.g., "AI SaaS companies with 100-500 employees")

---

### Known Biases: 6/10

**Potential Biases:**

1. **Selection Bias:** Survey respondents are self-selected from CNCF community members, likely over-representing cloud-native adopters vs. general enterprise population

2. **Survivorship Bias:** Organizations that failed with Kubernetes/cloud-native may be under-represented

3. **Vendor Influence:** CNCF is sponsored by cloud providers (AWS, Google, Microsoft, etc.) who produce managed Kubernetes offerings

4. **Geographic Bias:** Europe and Americas over-represented vs. Asia-Pacific and other regions

5. **Company Size Bias:** Large enterprises (1,000+ employees) represent 91% of respondents, under-representing small companies and startups

6. **Maturity Bias:** Survey asks about cloud-native maturity levels, which may skew toward organizations already on the journey vs. those not yet started

**Mitigation:** CNCF employs rigorous screening (2,700+ candidates disqualified in 2023) and stratified sampling by region and company size.

---

## Limitations — What This Source CANNOT Tell Us

### 1. AI SaaS Company Segmentation
CNCF surveys do NOT explicitly segment by "AI SaaS companies." Data points exist for:
- Organizations hosting generative AI models (66% use K8s for inference)
- AI/ML workloads generally (60% cloud-native)
- AI developers (41% cloud-native)

**But NOT:** SaaS companies specifically, AI-native startups vs. enterprises adding AI, or B2B SaaS vs. B2C SaaS platforms.

---

### 2. Precise Managed vs Self-Managed Percentages in 2024
The 2024 survey reports overlapping deployment environments:
- 59% on-premises + 59% public cloud (both skew self-managed)
- 46% managed public cloud
- 40% on-premises private cloud
- 39% hybrid cloud

**Limitation:** Organizations select MULTIPLE deployment types. Cannot derive a clean "X% managed, Y% self-managed" split without access to raw survey cross-tabulations.

---

### 3. Cloud-Native Non-K8s Managed Services
Serverless/FaaS data exists (11-22% range), but:
- No data on AWS Fargate, Google Cloud Run, Azure Container Apps usage
- No data on PaaS offerings (Heroku, Render, Railway, Fly.io)
- No breakdown of "non-Kubernetes container orchestration" (Docker Swarm, Nomad, ECS, etc.)

The 7% with "no Kubernetes engagement" could include:
- Pure serverless users
- PaaS users
- Traditional VM users
- Non-containerized workloads

**Cannot determine:** What percentage of organizations use "cloud-native managed services WITHOUT Kubernetes."

---

### 4. Kubernetes Distribution Breakdown
The 2021 survey provides managed provider rankings (EKS 39%, AKS 23%, AKS Engine 17%), but 2024 survey does NOT update these figures. External market research provides:
- EKS 22%, GKE 18%, AKS 19% (market share)
- 61% of production clusters on managed services

**Limitation:** These are cluster counts and market share, NOT "percentage of organizations using each provider."

---

### 5. Cost Economics and Decision Drivers
Surveys report:
- Serverless adoption split due to "cost and complexity"
- Security as top container challenge (40%)
- Lack of training for early adopters (46%)

**But NOT:**
- TCO analysis of managed vs self-managed
- Cloud spend percentages
- Cost as decision factor for architecture choices

---

### 6. Regional Data for Asia-Pacific AI/ML Adoption
Regional breakdowns exist for overall cloud-native adoption:
- Europe 82%, Americas 70%, Asia-Pacific 40%, Japan 18%

**But NOT:**
- AI/ML workload adoption by region
- Managed Kubernetes usage by region
- SaaS company adoption by region

---

### 7. Year-Over-Year Trends for Managed Kubernetes
Trend data available:
- Kubernetes production: 66% (2023) → 80% (2024)
- Managed services: 70% (2020) → 90% (2021) [Datadog]
- Serverless: 22% (2022) → 13% (2023) → 11% (2024)

**Missing:**
- Managed Kubernetes 2022-2024 trend
- Self-managed trend line
- Hybrid deployment trend

### 8. Workload Types Beyond AI/ML
Survey reports:
- Databases 69% cloud-native
- AI/ML 60% cloud-native

**But NOT:**
- Web applications
- API services
- Real-time streaming
- Batch processing
- Other workload types

---

### 9. Startup vs. Enterprise AI SaaS Patterns
Company size data exists:
- 34% of K8s users in 20,000+ employee orgs
- 34% in 1,000-5,000 employee orgs
- 9% in 500-1,000 employee orgs

**Missing:**
- <500 employee breakdown
- Startup-specific patterns
- Seed/Series A/B/C stage segmentation
- ARR or revenue-based segmentation

---

### 10. Multi-Cluster and Edge Deployment
Data exists on:
- Multi-cloud usage (56%)
- Hybrid cloud (39-56% by company size)

**But NOT:**
- Multi-cluster Kubernetes deployments
- Edge computing adoption
- Geographic distribution of clusters

## Confidence Score: 7/10

### Justification

**High Confidence (Score Drivers):**
1. **Authoritative Source:** CNCF is the governing body for Kubernetes and cloud-native ecosystem
2. **Rigorous Methodology:** Multi-year consistent surveys with quality screening
3. **Large Sample Sizes:** 750-3,800 respondents per survey
4. **Third-Party Validation:** Datadog and New Relic production data supplement self-reported data
5. **Trend Consistency:** Year-over-year trends show logical progression (K8s adoption growing, serverless declining)

**Medium Confidence (Score Reducers):**
1. **Missing SaaS Segmentation:** No explicit "AI SaaS company" segment
2. **Overlapping Deployment Data:** 2024 multi-environment data difficult to parse into clean percentages
3. **Selection Bias:** CNCF community likely over-represents cloud-native adopters
4. **Geographic Skew:** Under-representation of Asia-Pacific
5. **Company Size Skew:** 91% of respondents from 1,000+ employee organizations

**Applicability to Research Question:**
- **Question:** What percentage of AI SaaS companies use (a) cloud-native non-K8s managed services, (b) managed Kubernetes, (c) self-managed open Kubernetes?
- **Data Available:** Managed K8s ~79-90% of K8s users (high confidence), AI/ML workloads 66% on K8s for inference (medium confidence), serverless 11% (high confidence)
- **Data NOT Available:** "AI SaaS companies" as explicit segment, precise managed vs self-managed split for 2024, non-K8s cloud-native managed services

**Overall Assessment:** CNCF surveys provide the BEST publicly available data on Kubernetes and cloud-native adoption patterns, with strong trend data and large sample sizes. However, the surveys do NOT directly segment by "AI SaaS companies," requiring inference and triangulation with other sources (case studies, vendor data, industry analyst reports) to answer the research question precisely.

2. **CNCF End User Case Studies:** Review AI/ML company case studies (OpenAI, iFLYTEK, others) for qualitative architecture patterns

3. **Vendor-Specific Data:** AWS, Google Cloud, Azure publish customer adoption data for EKS/GKE/AKS that may include industry vertical breakdowns

4. **Analyst Reports:** Gartner, Forrester, 451 Research may have SaaS-specific Kubernetes adoption data

5. **Developer Survey Data:** Stack Overflow, JetBrains, SlashData developer surveys may segment by company type and infrastructure choices

6. **AI/ML-Specific Surveys:** Kaggle, Papers with Code, ML Ops community surveys may have infrastructure data for AI companies
