## Data Quality Assessment

**Completeness:**
- Infrastructure cost data: Moderate - ranges provided but sample sizes often unclear
- VC funding data: High - comprehensive coverage from CB Insights, Crunchbase
- Platform adoption: Moderate - survey-based with disclosed sample sizes for some
- Company-specific financials: Low - limited to press releases and select companies
- Architecture patterns by stage: Low - primarily guidance/recommendations not empirical data

**Recency:**
- Excellent: Most data from 2024-2025
- Several data points from Q4 2025 and Q1 2026
- Market projections extend to 2026-2030

**Sample Size:**
- Menlo Ventures survey: 495 U.S. enterprise AI decision-makers (disclosed)
- Platform engineering surveys: Sample sizes not disclosed
- VC funding data: Comprehensive database coverage (CB Insights, Crunchbase)
- Company financials: Limited to companies that disclose or leak data

**Known Biases:**
- VC Narrative Bias: Reports from a16z, Bessemer, Battery, Sequoia reflect their portfolio companies and investment theses. They may overweight trends they're invested in.
- Survivorship Bias: Cloud 100 and successful startups overrepresented; failed companies' infrastructure choices not captured
- Disclosure Bias: Only companies comfortable with their metrics share data publicly
- Geographic Bias: Heavy U.S. focus; limited international data
- Stage Bias: More data available for later-stage companies than seed/early stage
- Platform Vendor Bias: CAST AI, Komodor growth data from company announcements (self-reported)
- Foundation Model Bias: OpenAI/Anthropic economics not representative of typical AI SaaS

## Limitations — What This Source CANNOT Tell Us

**Critical Gaps:**

1. **Actual Infrastructure Architecture Choices**: VC reports describe what's being funded, not what companies are actually deploying. Investment in K8s platforms ≠ K8s adoption rates.

2. **Stage-Specific Architecture Patterns**: No empirical data showing "X% of Series A AI companies use Kubernetes" or "Y% of $10M ARR companies use serverless." Only recommendations and proxies.

3. **Cost-Architecture Correlation**: Cannot determine which specific architectural choices (K8s vs serverless, multi-cloud vs single cloud) correlate with the observed cost ranges.

4. **Failure Data**: No data on companies that chose wrong infrastructure early and failed. Survivorship bias throughout.

5. **Migration Patterns**: When do companies typically move from serverless to K8s? What triggers the shift? No data.

6. **SMB AI SaaS**: Data heavily skewed toward VC-backed, high-growth companies. No coverage of profitable, slower-growth AI SaaS in SMB segment.

7. **Infrastructure Team Sizing**: How many infrastructure engineers at different ARR levels? Not covered.

8. **Actual vs Projected**: Many data points are projections (Gartner 80% by 2026, market size forecasts) not current reality.

9. **Regional Variation**: Almost entirely U.S.-focused; cannot determine if patterns hold in EU/APAC.

10. **Open Source Self-Hosted**: No data on companies running own GPU infrastructure vs using cloud providers.

**Methodological Limitations:**

- **Proxy Signals**: Using "Kubernetes platform company funding" as proxy for K8s adoption is indirect. Companies can raise money for low-adoption products.
- **Definition Inconsistency**: "AI SaaS" vs "AI infrastructure" vs "generative AI" defined differently across sources
- **Temporal Mismatch**: Some data is 2023, some 2024, some 2025 projections - market moving too fast for apples-to-apples comparison
- **Self-Reported Data**: Company announcements (Komodor 400% growth, CAST AI savings) not independently verified

**What Would Actually Answer the Research Question:**

To know actual infrastructure choices at AI SaaS companies by stage, would need:
- Survey of 200+ AI SaaS companies across all stages asking: architecture type, cloud provider(s), orchestration platform, infrastructure % of revenue
- Case studies of 50+ companies showing infrastructure evolution from seed → Series A → Series B
- Anonymized infrastructure audit data from VC portfolios
- Cloud provider market share data by customer segment (not available publicly)

## Confidence Score: 6/10

**Justification:**

**What We Know with High Confidence (8-9/10):**
- AI infrastructure costs are significantly higher than traditional SaaS (24-50% vs 8-15% of revenue) - Multiple consistent sources
- VC investment in AI infrastructure is massive and growing ($225.8B in 2025) - Comprehensive database coverage
- Specific platform companies are growing rapidly (CAST AI, Komodor, Fireworks) - Company disclosures
- Enterprise AI spending is $37B with $18B on infrastructure - Large sample survey (Menlo)
- Gross margins for AI companies are lower than traditional SaaS - Multiple sources confirm

**What We Know with Moderate Confidence (5-7/10):**
- Platform engineering adoption at 55% of orgs - Survey-based but sample size/methodology unclear for some
- K8s recommended for late-stage, not early-stage - Consistent across sources but prescriptive not descriptive
- GPU clouds offer 62% cost advantage vs hyperscalers - Single source (CoreWeave pricing)
- Infrastructure spending improves as AI companies scale - Anthropic/OpenAI trajectory but limited sample

**What We Have Low Confidence In (3-4/10):**
- Specific architecture choices by ARR stage - No direct data, only recommendations
- When companies migrate from serverless to K8s - No data
- What % of AI SaaS companies actually use K8s vs serverless - No direct measurement
- Multi-cloud adoption patterns - Mentioned but not quantified

**Why Not Higher:**
- Heavy reliance on proxy signals (platform company funding ≠ adoption rates)
- Survivorship bias (only successful companies' data available)
- VC narrative bias (sources have vested interest in trends they're promoting)
- Lack of empirical architecture adoption data by stage
- Cannot definitively answer "what infrastructure do companies at $10M ARR typically use?"

**Why Not Lower:**
- Financial data (costs, margins, funding) is well-documented and consistent across sources
- Sample sizes are substantial where disclosed (495 for Menlo, comprehensive for funding databases)
- Multiple independent sources confirm key trends (high AI infrastructure costs, low margins)
- Recent data (2024-2025) covers the relevant time period
- Can confidently establish cost benchmarks even if not architecture patterns

**Bottom Line:**
This source provides excellent data on ECONOMICS (what AI infrastructure costs, funding trends, margin impacts) but weak data on ARCHITECTURE PATTERNS (what companies actually deploy at different stages). The 6/10 reflects high confidence in financial/investment trends, moderate confidence in platform adoption trends, and low confidence in specific architectural choice patterns by segment.
