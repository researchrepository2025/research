# Optimized Research Query: Enterprise AI Build vs. Buy Decision-Making

## Query Analysis

**Original Query Strengths:**
- Well-structured three-part framework (ideal state, barriers, solutions)
- Covers multiple dimensions: TCO, integration, vendor dynamics, organizational capabilities
- Requests specific examples and lessons learned
- Aspirational "What would easy look like?" framing encourages envisioning ideal outcomes

**Optimization Philosophy:**
The original hypothetical framing ("What would X look like?") is intentionally preserved. This aspirational approach helps identify ideal states worth pursuing. The optimization ensures that when answering these hypothetical questions, responses are grounded in documented evidence rather than pure speculation.

**Key Distinction:** We ask "imagine the ideal" but require "show me evidence of what that ideal looks like based on real examples."

**Critical Allowance - Ideal State Description:**
Even when no organization has fully achieved the ideal state, research should still describe what that ideal would look like. The ideal state can be established through:
- Logical extrapolation from current best practices
- Expert vision and thought leadership about where the field is heading
- Synthesis of partial achievements across multiple organizations
- First-principles reasoning about what "effortless" or "easy" would actually mean

The requirement is not that the ideal must exist today, but that the response clearly distinguishes between:
1. THE IDEAL: What we're striving toward (can be aspirational)
2. CLOSEST ACHIEVED: Who has come nearest (must be evidence-based)
3. THE GAP: What remains unachieved (must acknowledge current reality)

## Prompt Engineering Optimizations Applied

1. **Role Definition**: Established clear researcher identity with fact-finding mandate
2. **Source Quality Requirements**: Specified peer-reviewed, industry analyst reports, and named case studies
3. **Recency Constraints**: Required 2023-2025 data with allowance for foundational research
4. **Anti-Hallucination Guardrails**: Explicit instructions to cite sources, ground hypotheticals in evidence, and acknowledge gaps
5. **Evidence Type Specification**: Required statistics, named companies, specific dollar figures, and dated research
6. **Structured Output Requirements**: Defined clear sections with source attribution format
7. **Verification Requirements**: Cross-referencing mandate across multiple sources
8. **Evidence-Grounded Hypotheticals**: Hypothetical questions must be answered with real-world examples, documented frameworks, and case studies
9. **Quantitative Focus**: Emphasized measurable outcomes, percentages, and financial data
10. **Named Entity Requirements**: Required specific company names, vendor names, and framework names
11. **Ideal State Allowance with Gap Analysis**: Permits describing ideal states not yet fully achieved, while requiring best-in-class benchmarking, gap analysis, and path forward documentation
